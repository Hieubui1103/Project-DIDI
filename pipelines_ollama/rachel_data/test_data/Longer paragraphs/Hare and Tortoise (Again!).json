The tortoise did not asume\n airs because he had won, and the hare, realising he had ben defeated fair\n \n and square, bore the tortoise no grudge. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Many months pased. The king of the\n jungle where the hare and the tortoise\n lived had some important maters to\n \n discus with the king of the neighbouring\n jungle. \n But the first king could not leave his\n \n jungle just then. He decided, instead, to\n send the hare and tortoise to the\n \n neighbouring king, as his \n representatives. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"At least one of you must go to the neighbouring kingdom,\" \n \n ordered the king, when the hare and the tortoise had \n presented themselves. \n \n \n \"I want you to discus certain important maters with the \n king there, and come back to me with his thoughts on those \n maters.\" \n \n \n \"Now go!\" he said, as he dismised them. \"And mind, you \n \n only have a day to complete the task.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The road to the neighbouring kingdom\n \n was not smoth or easy. \n \n It was rocky and ful of thorns.\n \n \n There were also two rivers to cros on\n \n the way. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n After some thought, both the hare and \n the tortoise realised that neither of them \n could complete the task alone. \n \n \n They had to travel together. \n \n \n The plan was for the hare to cary the \n tortoise over the thorny parts of the \n \n route, and for the tortoise to cary the \n hare acros the two rivers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next day, they colected the various\n mesages from their king and were ready\n \n to go. \n \n The hare made short work of the thorny\n \n parts of the route with his giant loping\n strides, while the tortoise held on for\n \n dear life. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When they came to a river, they switched \n \n places, and the hare clambered onto the \n tortoise's back. \n \n \n The tortoise swam acros the river \n gracefuly. \n \n \n Once both rivers had ben crosed, it did \n not take them long to arive at the \n \n neighbouring kingdom. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n After long discusions with the \n \n neighbouring king on al the maters\n raised by their own king, the hare and the\n tortoise were ready to leave. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The journey home was even smother \n than the outward journey, since both the \n \n hare and the tortoise now knew exactly \n what to do. \n \n \n The two old rivals had worked so wel \n that they reached the king wel ahead of \n \n the deadline he had set! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15 "
