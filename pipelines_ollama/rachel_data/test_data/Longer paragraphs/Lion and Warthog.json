Please help me! Warthog!” cried Lion. \n “Please set me fre from this trap,” pleaded Lion. \n \n \n “Never,” said Warthog. \n “You are a cruel animal. You wil eat me and my family for \n \n breakfast if I set you fre.” \n \n \n “I promise I wil never do such a bad thing. We wil be friends \n if you can set me fre,” said Lion. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Warthog felt sory for Lion. \n \n \n “I do not like seing you in such pain,\n thirsty and dying from hunger.” \n \n \n So he puled at the trap with his long\n strong tusks and released Lion. \n \n \n Warthog saved his new friend. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Thank you very much my friend for \n \n saving my life,” said Lion. “I must go to \n my family now, god bye.” \n \n \n “Go wel my friend,” said Warthog. \n \n He was hapy that Lion was his friend. \n \n “My family wil never have to run from \n Lion again,” he thought. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Lion walked away limping and weak.\n \n \n He was also very hungry. \n \n \n Then he saw Warthog’s children playing\n in the mud. \n \n \n “Today is my lucky day,” said Lion with\n his mouth watering. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Hey Warthog, my new friend,” caled \n Lion. \n \n \n “I have ben caught in the trap for days \n without fod. But I am to weak to hunt. \n \n Please would you give one of your \n children to me for breakfast?” \n \n \n Warthog was shocked. \n \n \n “I saved you from the trap and now you \n want to eat my children?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “I am very sory my friend,” said Lion, “but\n I am starving. \n \n I might be weak for now but I am\n stronger than you.” \n \n \n Lion opened his mouth and showed his\n strong teth. \n \n \n “If you do not give me one of your\n children, I wil take one for myself,” he\n \n roared. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Warthog knew that he did not have the sped or the strength \n \n of Lion. \n \n \n He would never be able to protect his children in a fight. \n \n “Al right,” said Warthog. \n \n \n “I wil give you one of my children. \n \n But first I want you to show me how you were caught in the \n trap. \n In case I have to save another lion from this trap.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Lion imagined the wonderful taste of\n young warthog in his mouth. \n \n \n He could hardly wait. \n \n \n Lion went back to the trap and put his\n fot inside to show his friend how he\n \n was traped. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Ouch!” Lion roared. \n \n \n Warthog had closed the trap on Lion’s \n fot. \n \n \n “Aha! I got you,” said Warthog. \n \n \n “You wil stay in that trap hungry and \n thirsty again. \n \n Se if your strong teth and sharp claws \n can help you now.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Run! Run! Run away!” Warthog’s wife\n shouted to the children at the top of her\n \n voice. \n \n “Raise your tails when you are runing so\n \n that your father can se you,” she caled.\n \n \n The babies ran as fast as they could\n through the bushes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Warthog please help me!” beged Lion again. \n \n \n He was in pain from the sharp jaws of the hunter’s trap. \n \n \n “I wil do anything for you if you save me.” \n \n \n “No way, liar! I wil never believe you again,” said Warthog. \n \n \n “I wil also warn other animals not to save you because you \n are very sly.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Warthog saw his children runing in a row with their mother.\n \n Their tails were lifted up for him to se them.\n \n \n He rushed to his family and they al escaped to safety.\n \n \n To this day, warthogs and their children always run with their\n tails lifted up to se that everyone is safe. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 "
