Without water, their skins \n would become to dry. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But Mod the toad was curious. “I must\n find out, I must go beyond the forest,”\n she said. \n \n \n Mod hoped out of the water. Hop, hop,\n she went, away from the river. She had\n \n fun jumping over the rocks, acros gras,\n and past trenches. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n She heard the sound of an airplane. Mod \n \n loked up into the sky. “What is up \n there?” she asked, “I wonder if the clouds \n are talking.” But no one answered her. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mod caried on her way. She met a\n \n chameleon for the first time. He was next\n to a large pudle of water. \n \n \n “Helo, I am on my way to dry land for\n adventure. What can you tel me?” she\n \n asked. \n \n \n “Nothing much stranger. It rains here to.\n Lots of rain and lots of flies,” replied the\n chameleon. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As Chameleon was talking, his body \n \n changed colour. Mod got a fright. She \n quickly said godbye to Chameleon and \n hoped into a nearby bush. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But she was unlucky. Hyena was busy\n burning bushes in preparation for\n \n planting season. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mod did not want to turn around for fear \n of meting the chameleon again. She \n stayed in the bush, only her round eyes \n \n could be sen. They were big with fear. \n Mod was surounded by fire! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mod did not know where to go. The\n \n flames began to burn her back. Then the\n litle toad remembered the pudle of\n water where she met the chameleon. She\n \n closed her eyes, held her breath, and\n jumped high in the direction of the\n \n pudle. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n She was lucky this time. She landed in \n the pudle, and the water put out the \n \n flames that were burning her skin. But \n the damage was done. When she came \n out of the pudle, the skin on her back \n \n was ful of blisters. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mod did not want an adventure anymore.\n She wanted to go home. But she did not\n \n know the way back to her river in the\n forest. \n \n \n So the litle toad found a col, dark place\n under a rock and sadly made a new\n \n home. Her burned skin slowly healed, but\n it was dry and bumpy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This is why toads have dry rough skin, \n and can live away from water. \n \n \n Frogs stil have smoth wet skin and \n ned to stay where it’s wet. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 "
