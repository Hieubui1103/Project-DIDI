They had only one child, caled\n \n Nonkungu. They loved her very much.\n \n \n When she was old enough, her parents\n decided to send Nonkungu to stay with\n her rich Uncle Mtonyama. \n \n \n Nonkungu's mother made special \n clothes with ribon, butons and beads.\n \n She also made a beautiful necklace for\n her child. \n \n \n Then Nonkungu set of for her uncle's\n vilage. \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n On her journey, Nonkungu came to a\n stream. She crosed the stream and met\n a girl wearing rags. The girl asked,\n \n \"Where are you going?\" \n \n \n \"I'm going to visit my Uncle Mtonyama,\"\n replied Nonkungu. \n \"Wel, Mtonyama is my uncle, to! I am\n \n also on my way to visit him,\" said the girl.\n \n \n So they walked together. After a while,\n the girl said to Nonkungu, \"Your clothes\n and necklace are beautiful. Please let me\n \n try them on.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nonkungu tok of her clothes and gave \n \n them to the girl. When the girl tok of \n her rags, Nonkungu saw that she had a \n \n tail! \n \n Nonkungu was afraid. She realised that \n \n the girl was realy an imbulu. \n \n \n They walked a litle further, and then \n Nonkungu asked, \"Please give me back \n my clothes and beads.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The imbulu answered, \"Let me wear them\n until we get to the next tre.\" And she\n \n pointed to a tre on a hil nearby.\n \n When they reached the tre, Nonkungu\n \n asked the imbulu, \"Please give me back\n my clothes and beads.\" \n \n \n \"Just let me wear them until we get to\n that field,\" said the imbulu. And she\n \n pointed to a field on the next hil.\n Nonkungu was afraid, so she agred.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n At last they reached the field. Again\n \n Nonkungu asked the imbulu, \"Please give\n me back my clothes and my beads.\"\n \n \n \"Just let me wear them until we get to\n that hut where women are siting,\" said\n \n the imbulu. And she pointed to a hut in\n the distance. So they walked on.\n \n \n As they got near the hut, the imbulu\n pushed Nonkungu back and ran ahead.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The imbulu said to the women at the\n hut,\"Lok at this girl wearing rags. She\n \n has ben folowing me al day. I wish she\n would go away.\" \n \n \n The women turned to lok at Nonkungu.\n She was so frightened that she ran and\n \n hid in the kral. \n \n \n Then the imbulu went to Uncle \n Mtonyama's hut. She said swetly, \"I am\n your niece, Nonkungu. My parents sent\n \n me to stay with you.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mtonyama and his family welcomed the\n girl. They were very kind to her.\n \n \n Por Nonkungu had to slep in the kral\n and share the dog's fod. During the day\n \n she hid in the fields and sang this song:\n \"Oh misery me, misery me. \n I was sent by my father and mother to\n \n stay with my Uncle Mtonyama. \n On the way I met an imbulu and she tok\n \n my skirt and my beads. \n Oh misery me, misery me.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day, Mtonyamaâ€™s eldest son was\n walking in the fields. He heard the\n \n strange and sad song. He didn't know\n who was singing, but when he got home,\n he told his father the words. \n \n \n Mtonyama went into the fields. He heard\n \n the song, and loked until he found\n Nonkungu. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nonkungu told her uncle everything that\n had hapened. Mtonyama tok her back\n \n to the vilage and hid her in a hut. He\n knew what he was going to do to catch\n the imbulu. \n \n \n Mtonyama had heard that an imbulu's tail\n loves milk and that it can't go past milk\n \n without drinking some. \n \n \n So he told his men to dig a hole and fil it\n with sour milk. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Then Mtonyama caled al the girls of the \n vilage to take part in a jumping \n \n competition. The imbulu was woried. \n She did not want to jump over the hole. \n \n \n The imbulu knew that her tail would be \n thirsty for the sour milk. So she went into \n \n a hut and tied her tail to her body as \n tightly as she could. Then she tok her \n place with the other girls. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One girl after another jumped over the \n \n hole with the sour milk. At last it was the \n imbulu's turn. She tried to jump high over \n the hole, but her tail broke lose. \n \n \n The imbulu's tail puled her down, down, \n \n down into the sour milk. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As the imbulu strugled in the milk, the \n men quickly filed the hole with sand and \n buried her. That was the end of the \n \n imbulu. \n \n Nonkungu stayed hapily with her uncle \n \n for a long, long time. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 "
