No one had anything to eat except\n \n the crows. \n \n \n Each morning they flew a long distance\n to where there was a tre with ripe figs in\n the midle of a wide river. Then they flew\n \n back with the figs for themselves and\n their relatives. \n \n \n The sight of so many figs made Anansi's\n mouth water. How could he get them for\n \n himself? \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He thought of a plan. \n He carefuly covered his botom with \n \n sticky beswax. Then he tok a piece of \n clay pot and went to se the crows. \n \n \n “Please could you help me?” he asked. “I \n ned a live coal to get my fire going \n \n again.” \n As they were geting the coal from the \n \n fire, Anansi carefuly sat firmly on one of \n the largest figs, so that it would stick to \n his botom. He thanked the crows, and \n \n huried home to enjoy the fig. \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n But one fig wasn’t enough for him. He\n \n went back a second time, and did the\n same. When he went back a third time,\n \n the crows began to get suspicious.\n \n “Why do you kep coming back to us to\n \n get a coal?” they said. Anansi answered,\n “Every time when I get home, the coal\n has burnt out.” \n \n \n “You’re lying!” said the crows. “You just\n \n want our fod!” \n “That’s not true,” said Anansi. \n And he started crying. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The crows felt sory for him. The next \n morning at first light, each crow gave him \n \n a feather. He flew with them to the fig \n tre in the midle of the wide river. When \n he saw the luscious figs, Anansi wanted \n \n them al for himself. \n \n Each time a crow tried to pick a fig, he \n \n shouted out, “That one is mine! I saw it \n first!” And then he tok the fig and put it \n \n into his bag. Eventualy he had al the figs \n and the crows had none. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He was left al alone as the darknes\n began to fal. \n \n \n “If I don’t want to stay in this tre for the\n rest of my life,” he said to himself, “I’l\n \n just have to jump into the air like the\n crows”. \n \n \n So he tok a dep breath, jumped,\n and…PLOP! \n \n He fel into the river right among the\n crocodiles. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “What do we have here?” said a gruf \n crocodile voice. “A tasty morsel to eat, \n \n nyum…” \n “Oh please don’t,” said Anansi. And he \n began to cry. “I’m one of you, don’t you \n \n know? I got lost in the days of your \n grandfathers and no one was able to find \n me. You’re the first of my relatives I’ve \n \n ever met!” \n \n \n He cried so much that the crocodiles felt \n sory for him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The oldest crocodile said, “We’l know\n you’re one of us if you can eat and enjoy\n \n mud soup just like we do.” \n They gave him a pot of dirty brown water.\n “Just like my grandmother used to make\n \n it!” Anansi said. \n \n But he made a hole in the ground with his\n \n back fot, and a hole in the pot with his\n front fot. As he pretended to drink the\n \n soup, it ozed down through the pot into\n the hole beneath his fet. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Delicious!” he exclaimed, giving back the \n \n empty pot. \n \n \n “Now we know you are definitely one of \n us,” the crocodiles said. \n So they alowed Anansi to slep in their \n \n hole with them for the night. \n \n \n “Tomorow morning I’l tel you the story \n of my life,” said Anansi as they fel \n aslep. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Early the next morning, before first light,\n \n Anansi woke up one of the crocodiles.\n “I want to go and fetch my wife and\n children from acros the river, so that\n \n they can help me tel my story. Wil you\n help me before the others wake up?” he\n \n asked the crocodile. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The crocodile was grumpy at being \n \n woken up so early. \n “Please help me! You swim much faster \n than I do,” Anansi said. \n \n The crocodile agred, and Anansi rode \n on his back to the bank of the river. \n \n \n He climbed of quickly. “I’l be back son! \n Don’t go away!” Anansi said, as he \n \n disapeared through the gras. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As far as we know, the crocodile is\n \n waiting for him stil, with just his long\n snout and his beady eyes above the\n surface of the river. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 "
