I've \n walked so far today, and I'm so tired and \n \n hungry.” \n \n So what could Anansi do but let him in? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Anansi was to selfish to share his\n beautiful delicious yams with anybody\n \n else. So he came up with a nasty plan.\n \n \n Just as Turtle sat down at the table and\n began to reach for some yams, Anansi\n yeled at him, “Turtle, your hands are al\n \n dirty! You can't eat with your hands al\n dirty! Go wash them.” \n \n \n Turtle's hands realy were dirty. So he\n slowly crawled to the river, washed his\n \n hands, and then crawled back. \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But meanwhile Anansi had started \n gobling up the yams. By the time Turtle \n \n got back, he saw that the yams were al \n gone. \n \n \n Turtle loked at Anansi. “Thank you for \n inviting me to diner. If you're ever near \n my house, please come by and let me \n \n return the favour,” said Turtle. \n \n \n And Turtle began crawling slowly away to \n his house. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n As time went by, Anansi began to think\n \n more and more about how Turtle had\n promised to fed him a fre diner. So\n one day he walked over to Turtle's house.\n \n \n Anansi got to Turtle's house just about\n \n dinertime, as the sun was going down\n over the river. Turtle was lying on a rock\n in the sun, warming himself up, as turtles\n \n do. \n \n \n When Turtle saw Anansi, he said, “Helo\n there, Anansi, have you come to have\n diner with me?” \n \n And Anansi said, “Yes, that would be very\n nice, thank you.” He was geting hungrier\n and hungrier. \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So Turtle dived down to the botom of \n \n the river to set the table for diner and \n get everything ready. Anansi waited on \n the rocks by the shore. \n \n \n Son Turtle swam back up and said, “Oh \n Anansi, it is al ready now, please join me \n \n for diner.” And Turtle dived down again \n and began to eat the gren leaves he had \n \n for diner. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Anansi tried to dive down to the botom\n of the river, but he was a spider, not a\n \n turtle, and he couldn't dive that dep. He\n kept floating back up to the surface\n again. \n \n \n He tried jumping in, he tried diving in, but\n \n nothing helped. He just couldn't get down\n to that diner. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Finaly Anansi had an idea. He put lots of \n \n stones in the pockets of his coat, and \n finaly he was heavy enough to sink down \n to the botom of the river. \n \n \n How clever he was! \n \n \n He saw Turtle's table, ful of juicy gren \n leaves and lots of other delicious fod. \n \n Anansi's mouth was watering. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But just as Anansi was reaching for\n \n some of that delicious fod, Turtle\n stoped him. “Anansi, surely you're not\n going to eat diner with your coat on?\n \n That's not how we do things at my\n house.” \n \n \n Anansi, without thinking, said, “Oh, of\n course you're right, Turtle, what was I\n \n thinking?” He tok of his coat.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But without the rocks in his pockets to \n hold him down, Anansi floated right back \n to the surface of the river again, and \n \n poped out of the water. \n \n Anansi sadly put his head down into the \n \n water and watched Turtle eat up al of \n the delicious fod! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 "
