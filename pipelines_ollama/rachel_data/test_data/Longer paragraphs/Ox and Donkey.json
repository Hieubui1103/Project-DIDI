The plough is big and heavy. The\n \n farmer never lets me rest.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The donkey loked at the ox. \n \"The ox is lazy,\" he thought. \"He doesn't \n \n like to work.\" \n \n \"Do you think your plough is heavy?\" he \n \n cried. \"Believe me, my friend, it is light! I \n was carying a sack of tef on my back \n \n today. It was heavier than your plough, I \n am sure.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next day, the two animals met again.\n \"I had a bad day today,\" the ox said. \"My\n master's field is far away, and it was ful\n \n of stones. I worked hard al day. I didn't\n have any rest.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"You worked hard?\" said the donkey. \"I \n \n went to the market today. It was in the \n town, many kilometres away. I'm sure I \n worked harder than you.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next day, the ox came home late\n again. \n \n \"Oh, my friend,\" he said to the donkey.\n \"Today was a very bad day for me.\"\n But the donkey didn't want to listen to the\n \n ox any more. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"You're always tired,\" he said. \"Every day\n is a bad day for you. Listen, I have a god\n \n idea. Tomorow, when the farmer comes,\n lie down on the ground. Close your eyes,\n and say, ‘Mo! Mo!’ The farmer wil\n \n think that you are il. He wil let you rest.\"\n The ox liked the donkey's idea. \"Thank\n \n you, dear donkey, that's a very god idea,\"\n he said. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So the next morning, the ox lay down on \n \n the ground. When the farmer came, the \n ox closed his eyes. \n \"Mo! Mo!\" he said. \n \n \n The farmer loked at him. \n \"My por old ox is sick,\" he said. \"But I \n \n must plough my field. Who wil help me? \n Why, there is my donkey! He can pul the \n \n plough today.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The farmer tok the donkey out to his\n field. He tied the plough to the donkey,\n and began to hit him with his whip.\n \n \"Go on! Faster! Pul!\" he caled out to the\n donkey. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The donkey worked hard al day, and in \n \n the evening he was very tired. \n \n \n Slowly, he walked home. \n \n The ox was waiting for him. \n \n \"Dear donkey,\" the ox said. \"I had a lovely \n day today. I ate some gras, drank some \n \n water and I rested under a big tre. I \n want to rest again tomorow. What shal I \n do? Give me another idea.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The donkey loked at the ox. \n \n \"His work is much worse than mine,\" he\n thought. \"I don't want to do it again\n \n tomorow.\" \n \n \"My friend,\" he said at last. \"You must be\n \n careful. The farmer was talking to his\n wife today. I heard him saying 'My ox is\n \n always tired and now he is sick. If he is\n not beter tomorow, I wil kil him, and\n we can eat the meat.'\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The ox was very frightened. \n \n \"What? Did he say that?\" he cried. \"Then I \n wil work tomorow. I fel quite beter \n now. I'm not tired at al!\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 "
