The tres dried up and died. \n The rivers disapeared and the water evaporated. People and animals \n began dying from hunger and thirst. \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Lion and Elephant as the chief animals got together to discus the situation. \n Lion said, “We’re going to end up dying from thirst. Let’s cal everyone \n \n together and discus the idea of diging a wel. Elephant agred and went \n of to spread the news to al the animals. \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Al the animals except the hare got together to discus the situation. \n Lion said, “Lok, my brothers and sisters, this year, the rain has not falen.\n \n Everyone is dying from hunger and thirst. Let us now make a plan to dig \n a wel so that we might al be able to drink from it.” \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Al the animals agred and imediately grabed hoes, shovels and picks \n and started diging. They dug and dug. And they dug some more. \n \n Finaly they hit water. Lion said, “Why did Hare not come to dig this wel? \n He most certainly wil not drink from this water!” \n \n 4  \n \n \n Later Hare came and saw the wel. He said, “Tipite, tipite at the wel!” \n \n He heard nothing. So he went in, drank some water and splashed \n around for a while. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n The next day, when the animals came they saw that their wel was a \n big mes. The water was nothing but mud. They asked, “Who would \n \n do such a thing?” Someone said, “I bet it was Hare. When we were \n diging the wel he was nowhere to be found.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And so the animals decided to leave a guard at the wel. They chose Babon\n \n to kep an eye on things. Babon was at the wel when Hare came at night\n saying, “Tipite! Tipite! by the water!” Babon replied, “Pitani!” \n \n \n So Hare came over and greted Babon, “I have come, my friend, and I bring\n that which the great ones like to eat!” \n \n Babon replied, “Come, let’s se what it is.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n Hare had some honey. He went over to Babon, “Yes, my friend, \n try some of this!” Hare gave him the honey. \n \n Then he drew some water from the wel and drank it. \n Just as Hare was leaving, Hyena arived and he saw Hare. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n The next day, Hyena went and told al the animals that Hare had \n taken water from the wel. So they chose Turtle to guard the wel. \n \n Hare arived at night, saying, “Tipite by the wel!” When he didn’t \n hear any reply he said: “I am Hare! I’ve come to drink water.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n When Turtle had arived at the wel earlier that night, she had hiden \n herself among the rocks. She loked just like another rock. As son as \n \n Hare started to go into the water, Turtle grabed Hare by the leg. Turtle \n didn’t say a word, she just sat there holding on until the sun came up. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n When the animals arived, they saw that Turtle had captured Hare. \n They caled the rest of the animals to decide what to do with Hare. \n \n When al the animals were asembled, Lion asked them, “What shal \n we do with this Hare?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Turtle said, “Elephant should grab him with her trunk and beat him on \n the rocks.” Al the other animals agred. Then Hare said, “O Great Lion, \n \n you know that hares don’t die if you hit them on rocks. The Hare wil only \n die if he is thrown into ash.” So Lion told Elephant to throw Hare into ash. \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n After Hare was completely covered with ash, Elephant picked him up \n and threw him. When Hare landed he made a big cloud of dust. \n The dust was everywhere. \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When the dust setled, the animals \n loked around. Hare was gone! \n \n \n They realised that Hare had tricked \n them again. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14 "
