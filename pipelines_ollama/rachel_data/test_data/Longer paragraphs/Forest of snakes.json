We are \n \n coming to where Unyalego lives.”\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Atieno caled to the others, “Lok, here\n are Unyalego’s golden teth. Let us take\n them.” \n \n \n Apiyo reminded them, “Don't forget\n grandmother’s warning. We must not\n \n take anything from the forest except\n firewod.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ajoh said, “I don't trust grandmother. I\n think she said that to stop us having\n what we want. I want the golden teth.”\n \n \n Her sisters were woried. “Ajoh, we\n warned you,” they said. \n \n \n Ajoh did not care. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n At that moment Unyalego came \n loking for his golden teth. He was\n \n furious when he could not find the\n teth. \n \n \n Then Unyalego heard the girls \n chating and laughing. He hid under\n \n a rock next to the road where the\n girls would pas on their way back.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The sisters were going home carying\n their firewod on their heads. \n \n \n Sudenly, they heard “Hz!” There\n was Unyalego with his mouth \n wide open, ready to bite. The girls\n \n were terified. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Unyalego asked the girls, “Who \n \n tok my golden teth?” No one \n answered. \n \n \n The snake decided to test the girls.\n “Whoever is inocent, wil be able\n \n to sing without mistakes. She wil\n go home with her firewod. \n \n But the guilty one wil sing badly.\n She wil be my fod for the next\n thre days!” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Apiyo started to sing with a clear\n voice: \n \n \n “Sio mimi, sio mimi aliye na meno,\n Mwenye meno bado yuko nyuma.” \n \n \n Then Atieno sang the song. She also\n sang wel. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Lastly, it was Ajoh’s turn. She was\n \n scared. She steped forward and \n started singing. But her singing\n \n sounded terible and the words \n were wrong. \n \n \n Unyalego shouted, “Can’t you sing\n properly like the others?” \n \n \n The snake knew that Ajoh tok his\n golden teth. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Unyalego opened his huge jaws and\n swalowed Ajoh. \n \n \n Her sisters ran back to the vilage.\n They told everyone the story of what\n \n hapened. \n \n \n “I warned her, if only she had listened,”\n the girls' grandmother said sadly.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 "
