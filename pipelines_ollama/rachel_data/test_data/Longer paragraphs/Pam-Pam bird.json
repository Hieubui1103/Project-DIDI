He brought home fat\n \n animals and fed his family wel.\n \n \n There was this bird, the Pam-Pam bird,\n which Pensa wanted to catch. The bird’s\n tail feathers were perfect for his arows.\n \n The problem was, he could never \n manage to trap or shot Pam-Pam.\n \n \n Pensa’s arows would fly through the air\n just like a bird - if only he could catch\n \n Pam-Pam and pul out his tail feathers!\n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Pensa went to the wise man, their healer. \n He asked for help. “Please guide me to \n \n catch the Pam-Pam bird. I ned his \n feathers for my bow and arows. What \n must do to catch him?” \n \n \n The healer replied, “Go and make a fire. \n When al the insects run away from your \n \n fire, you must catch the smalest of \n them. Make a trap and place this litle \n \n insect inside your trap. It wil tempt the \n Pam-Pam bird.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Pensa did not know that the healer and\n \n the Pam-Pam bird were friends. Pam-\n Pam often visited the healer. They\n exchanged stories. \n \n \n “I warn you,” said the healer when Pam-\n Pam bird visited him, “I have told the\n \n hunter how to catch you. When you se a\n fire in the veld, you must fly far away. I\n \n want to se which one of you wil win.”\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In the meantime, Pensa started his hunt\n for the Pam-Pam bird. He sat in the veld\n \n and rubed and rubed his fire sticks.\n When the smoke apeared, he blew into\n the fine gras around his fire sticks, until\n \n the litle flame apeared and became a\n fire. \n \n \n The insects around the flaming gras\n flew away, but Pensa managed to catch\n \n a young grashoper. He put it into his\n trap. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Pam-Pam bird could not resist the \n juicy young grashoper in Pensa’s trap. \n \n He decided to fly down and grab it \n quickly with his sharp beak. \n \n \n Pensa heard Pam-Pam bird’s cry, “Pam- \n pam, pam-pam, pam-pam.” \n \n Pensa ran to his trap. The bird was \n traped! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Pam-Pam bird beged Pensa to set him\n fre. \n \n “Oh no,” said Pensa, “I have wanted to\n catch you for a very long time. Today you\n are mine! Your feathers wil make my\n \n arow fly through the air, just like you.”\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Pam-Pam bird screched, “If you kil me \n you wil have no more feathers for your \n \n arow when these are worn out, because \n I wil be dead. Set me fre and I promise \n to give you new feathers with each ful \n \n mon.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n That night, the healer led the people in a\n fire dance to celebrate the hunter’s\n suces and Pam-Pam bird’s fredom.\n \n \n And since that day, al the god hunters\n remember the story of the Pam-Pam bird,\n \n to tel their children as a memory of days\n gone by. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Pensa went home and made new arows. \n \n When the people saw his new arows, \n they exclaimed: \n “O-o, lok at this hunter! He caries the \n \n Pam-Pam bird’s feathers in his arows. \n Now he wil hunt wel and bring us god \n \n fod. We shal have a feast!” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n That night, the healer led the people in a\n fire dance to celebrate the hunter’s\n suces and Pam-Pam bird’s fredom.\n \n \n And since that day, al the god hunters\n remember the story of the Pam-Pam bird,\n \n to tel their children as a memory of days\n gone by. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Story notes \n \n In 198 !Xun storyteler Pensa Limungu (1949 – 207) sung this oral tale,\n acompanied by the traditional Khonga, to Marlene Winberg who translated\n it with the help of Kapilolo Mahongo.
