It is\n \n blocking my path.” \n The two ladies pushed and pushed,\n \n but that pumpkin did not move. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n They went to ‘M’e Maselo. \n “Please help us move ‘M’e Maneo’s \n pumpkin!” they asked. \n \n ‘M’e Maselo came to help them. \n The thre ladies pushed and pushed \n that pumpkin, but stil it did not move. \n \n “I don’t know what to do,” said ‘M’e \n Maneo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Just then a litle worm came into ‘M’e\n Maneo’s garden.

Two shepherds\n found it. \n \n “What shal we do with this pumpkin?”\n they asked. \n “Let’s eat it,” they said, “it loks\n \n delicious.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n They tok a big stone and tried \n to break open the pumpkin. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “No!” cried the pumpkin. \n The shepherds jumped back. \n \n The pumpkin began to open. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Out of the pumpkin came a moloi. \n \n She had one arm, one eye and one leg. \n She loked terible. \n “Don’t disturb me,” said the moloi \n \n in a big voice, “I am the pumpkin chief.” \n The pumpkin closed again. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The shepherds were very frightened.\n They ran home to tel their parents.\n \"Oh! We are so lucky!\" said their parents.\n \n \"Don’t you know about the pumpkin\n moloi?\" \n \"It is a very special pumpkin,\" said the\n \n shepherds' parents. \"You must leave it\n alone.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Next sumer the pumpkin wil open again and the moloi wil scater \n pumpkin seds al over our vilages.
