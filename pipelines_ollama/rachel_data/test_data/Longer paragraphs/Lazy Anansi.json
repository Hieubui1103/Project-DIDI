I’l come back \n later,” said Anansi. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “How wil I cal you when they’re ready?”\n \n asked Rabit. \n Anansi thought for a minute. \n “I'l spin a web,” he said, “and tie one end\n \n around my leg and one end to your pot.\n When the grens are ready, pul on the\n web string and I’l come right away.”\n \n \n So Anansi tied the web to the pot, and\n \n walked on. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A short while later he saw Monkey and \n his wife, coking some beans in a large \n \n pot. \n “Come and join us!” they said. “The \n beans are nearly ready.” \n \n “Sory, I have things to do,” said Anansi \n before they could ask him to help. \n “But let me tie one end of this web \n \n around my leg and one end to your pot. \n When the beans are ready, pul on the \n \n web string, and I’l come.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He walked on until he smeled swet\n potatoes. \n \n “Anansi,” caled his friend Warthog. “My\n pot is ful of swet potatoes and honey!\n Come and share my fod with me. Here’s\n \n a fork for you to help me stir.”\n \n “I’l come back later,” said Anansi quickly.\n \n “But let me tie one end of this web\n around my leg and one end to your pot.\n \n When the swet potatoes are ready, pul\n on the web string, and I’l come.”\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n By the time Anansi arived at the river, \n \n each of his eight legs was tied to a \n diferent pot of delicious fod. \n Just then, Anansi felt a tug on one of his \n \n legs. \n “Rabit’s fod is ready!” he said, licking \n \n his lips. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He felt a second tug. \n And a third. \n And a fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth.\n \n Everyone was puling on the web strings\n at the same time! \n “Stop! Stop!” he cried in pain, as his legs\n \n were stretched thiner and thiner.\n But no one could hear him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Finaly, the web strings could hold no \n longer. They snaped one by one. \n Anansi roled into the river to sothe his \n \n painful legs. But his legs would not \n return to their normal shape. \n And he was to embarased to go to \n \n any of his friends and share their fod \n that day. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8 "
