Sometimes Malasile even \n \n forgot about his family. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Then one day Malasile wondered to\n himself, “If I ever fel sick, would my\n \n friend Wetsakhulya help me?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Malasile thought of a plot to test the \n \n depth of their friendship. He bled blod \n from a cow and put it in a pot with a lid. \n He put the pot in his rom. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Malasile stayed in his rom for four days\n and four nights. There was a foul smel\n \n of roting blod coming from the rom.\n The bad smel spread through the whole\n house and compound. \n \n \n Malasile asked his wife, “Tel the family\n \n and my friend Wetsakhulya that I have a\n terible disease and wil die son.”\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When his family and friend were in his \n compound, Malasile removed the lid \n \n from the pot of roting blod. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The smel from the rom was sickening.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Son enough Wetsakhulya began to walk \n away. With his hand on his nose, holding \n his breath, he cried, “I’m shocked! My \n \n friend is roting away!” Wetsakhulya left \n the compound. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But the family forced the dor of\n \n Malasile’s rom open. They wanted to\n know what type of disease was kiling\n Malasile. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The family found Malasile siting on his \n bed, grining as he sucked his milet \n ber. He pointed to a huge pot of malwa \n \n that he had brought for them to enjoy. \n \n “I apreciate your concern,” said Malasile \n \n to his family. “I know now who I can rely \n on.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9 "
