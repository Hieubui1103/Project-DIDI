Push these sily cows\n away from here,” she insisted. “They are\n \n eating my clothes.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Where is the owner of these sily cows?” \n she shouted. “They are eating my grains.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sorimpan, the herd boy, had just gone to\n drink water at a tap when his cows\n \n wandered of to the market. \n \n He hid away, squating in fear, when he\n \n heard the shouting woman. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Now lok what these sily cows have \n done!” she continued to shout. “They \n \n have broken my beautiful pots.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A short time later, “Aah! Not again!” she\n \n was heard saying. “I wil report this\n mater to the police. These sily cows\n have knocked down my fruit stand.”\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sorimpan finaly came out stick in hand, \n \n dodged betwen the gathering crowds \n and managed to get a clear view of his \n cows. \n \n Sorimpan’s cows knew him wel so they \n turned and loked up at him as he \n \n apeared! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n At this point, the big crowd of onlokers \n \n of men, women and even children al \n stared at the cows which paid atention \n only to Sorimpan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sudenly, the cows broke their silence!\n They began to talk al at the same time,\n \n criticising the people! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The crowds were shocked and steped back one by one, \n afraid of the cows. \n \n \n Then the cows stoped talking and watched the crowd in \n amazement! \n \n \n But Mama Schola was heard saying, “Since when did cows \n medle in our market busineses?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was Mama Schola’s turn to be \n \n criticised by the cows! \n Al the other women seling moved to \n stand with Mama Schola out of fear. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The cows criticised the women, \n \n comenting on the state of their\n vegetables, saying, \n “What kind of vegetables are these? They\n \n are al old and drying up!” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was clear that the cows were not yet \n done! \n \n They turned round and faced the cloth- \n stand and shouted, “You say we eat your \n clothes, what clothes? You mean these \n \n old rugs! Who wil buy them?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The cows then moved to the next stand \n and everybody folowed them with their \n \n eyes. \n “Your grains are ful of wevils. Who \n wants to eat that! We only tasted to se \n \n if this is a place to come more often!” the \n cows snered. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “And you Mama Schola,” the cows \n continued, “stop making noise. You talk\n of these cracked pots?” The cows turned\n \n their heads towards Mama Schola’s pots.\n “They are no god, they break so easily,\n so don’t blame us.” \n \n \n With that, the cows turned and left,\n \n folowed closely by Sorimpan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 "
