His \n skin was ful of pimples. His lips were \n \n to smal to cover his dark brown teth. \n He had a dep scar acros half his face. \n \n \n The man was folowing us! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n We decided to stop and face the \n stranger. My heart beat so loudly that I \n thought he could hear it. I stared at him, \n \n noticing his features and clothes. \n \n He did not like the fact that I was loking \n \n at him so kenly. He shouted, “What are \n you loking at, boy?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n At that point, we turned to run. I was not \n \n fast enough. He caught me by my shirt \n and puled me back roughly. \n \n \n The man held me so tight that I thought \n my ribs would crack. But my friend Kiki \n \n escaped. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The tal man picked me up like a piece of \n crumpled paper. He threw me into a van \n \n parked in the field. Then he got in the \n front of the van. \n \n \n Another man inside the van blindfolded \n me and tied my hands behind my back. \n \n Then the driver drove away at the sped \n of an ambulance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The man next to me held a wet rag over \n my face. The liquid on the rag smeled \n \n swet, and made me fel slepy and \n dizy. I fel aslep. \n \n \n When I woke up I found myself siting on \n the flor in a dark rom with cobwebs \n \n and mice. At least I was no longer \n blindfolded. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The dor of the dark rom opened \n \n noisily, and a man entered carying a \n plate. He was the man who tied me up \n and put me to slep. \n \n \n “Here is fod for you. You beter eat \n because you are going on a long journey,” \n \n mumbled the man. He cut the rope \n around my hands with a sharp knife \n \n hanging from his belt. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When I heard the word ‘journey’ I decided \n \n to eat. I would ned to get the strength to \n rescue myself. \n \n \n As I ate, the man sat down and smoked a \n cigarete. The smoke filed the entire \n \n rom. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The other two men came in draging a \n \n boy. It was Kiki! They had caught him as \n wel. Now we were both traped in the \n dark rom. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I understod that the tal ugly man was \n \n the leader of the group. He gave orders \n to the other two. But the man who \n brought me the fod did not sem to like \n \n what they were doing. \n \n A while later, we heard them arguing \n \n outside the rom. The leader shouted, “I \n don’t care if you know his family. You \n \n can’t change your mind now.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This argument made us realise that one \n \n of them knew us. I wondered who it was. \n Kiki said, “We must find a way of \n \n escaping. Our parents don’t have the \n money to pay.” \n \n \n I untied my friend and luck was on our \n side. The men continued to disagre and \n \n started fighting. We quietly bolted the \n dor inside the rom and started loking \n for a way to escape. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n We saw some thin cracks of light \n \n betwen old planks of wod nailed \n acros one wal. We puled at a plank \n until the nails came out of the crumbling \n \n wal. \n \n We puled at another plank, and another, \n \n until the thin dim light became brighter. \n There was a smal broken window \n \n boarded up with those planks! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Quickly we made a decision. Kiki was \n faster and smaler than me, so he would \n run to get help. I helped him up. \n \n \n Kiki wrigled out of the window. It wasn’t \n far to the ground outside, and I heard him \n \n land on his fet, and take a dep breath. \n Then he was gone. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n By this time the men had heard the noise \n \n we made, and were kicking the dor \n against the bolt. They \n \n burst into the rom and stod for a \n minute loking at the window. \n \n \n Then they rushed outside, pushing each \n other, not sure which direction to go. The \n \n men were furious, especialy the ugly \n leader. He hit me, shouting, “Your parents \n wil pay for this!” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The men nailed back the planks of wod \n \n over the window and locked me in the \n rom. But they stil could not agre about \n \n what to do. I could hear them arguing \n again. \n \n \n The man who smoked a lot wanted to let \n me go. The driver was woried that my \n \n friend would find his way back and bring \n the police. And the ugly leader, wel, he \n wanted the ransom money. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It semed like forever before I heard a \n soft tap from outside, on the broken \n window. A grown up voice said, “Don’t be \n \n scared. Police are here. Lie on the flor, \n cover your head. Don’t move.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I’m not sure what hapened next. \n \n Everything hapened! \n \n The men were taken by surprise as \n \n police stormed the rom they were in. \n There was lots of shouting and noise, \n \n and some gunshots. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 18  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A policewoman opened the dor to my \n \n rom. She picked me up of the flor, and \n wraped a blanket around me. \n \n \n She told me, “Your friend was lucky. He \n found the main road near here. We were \n driving on patrol when he ran into the \n \n road. After we heard his story, we caled \n for backup and came to teach these \n \n criminals a leson!” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 19  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The thre men were arested, \n handcufed, and bundled into a police \n van. I got into a car with the \n \n policewoman. She tok me home to my \n woried parents. \n \n \n After that day, Kiki and I were more \n careful when we went exploring. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 20 "
