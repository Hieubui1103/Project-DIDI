But best of\n \n al were the bananas. \n \n Although Grandma had many \n \n grandchildren, I secretly knew that I was\n her favourite. She invited me often to her\n house. She also told me litle secrets.\n \n \n But there was one secret she did not\n \n share with me: where she ripened\n bananas. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day I saw a big straw basket placed \n in the sun outside Grandma’s house. \n \n When I asked what it was for, the only \n answer I got was, “It’s my magic basket.” \n \n \n Next to the basket, there were several \n banana leaves that Grandma turned from \n time to time. \n \n \n I was curious. “What are the leaves for, \n \n Grandma?” I asked. The only answer I \n got was, “They are my magic leaves.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was so interesting watching Grandma,\n the bananas, the banana leaves and the\n \n big straw basket. But Grandma sent me\n of to my mother on an erand. \n \n \n “Grandma, please, let me watch as you\n prepare…” \n \n “Don’t be stuborn, child, do as you are\n told,” she insisted. I tok of runing.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When I returned, Grandma was siting \n \n outside but with neither the basket nor \n the bananas. \n \n \n “Grandma, where is the basket, where are \n al the bananas, and where…” \n \n \n But the only answer I got was, “They are \n in my magic place.” \n \n It was so disapointing! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Two days later, Grandma sent me to\n \n fetch her walking stick from her\n bedrom. \n \n \n As son as I opened the dor, I was\n welcomed by the strong smel of ripening\n bananas. In the iner rom was \n \n grandma’s big magic straw basket. It was\n wel hiden by an old blanket. I lifted it\n \n and snifed that glorious smel.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Grandma’s voice startled me when she\n \n caled, “What are you doing? Hury up\n and bring me the stick.” \n \n \n I huried out with her walking stick.\n \n \n “What are you smiling about?” Grandma\n asked. \n \n Her question made me realise that I was\n stil smiling at the discovery of her magic\n place. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The folowing day when grandma came \n to visit my mother, I rushed to her house \n \n to check the bananas once more. \n \n There was a bunch of very ripe ones. I \n \n picked one and hid it in my dres. After \n covering the basket again, I went behind \n \n the house and quickly ate it. It was the \n swetest banana I had ever tasted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The folowing day, when grandma was in\n \n the garden picking vegetables, I sneaked\n in and pered at the bananas. \n \n \n Nearly al were ripe. I couldn’t help taking\n a bunch of four. \n \n \n As I tiptoed towards the dor, I heard\n \n grandma coughing outside. I just\n managed to hide the bananas under my\n dres and walked past her. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The folowing day was market day. \n \n Grandma woke up early. She always tok \n ripe bananas and casava to sel at the \n market. \n \n \n I did not hury to visit her that day. But I \n \n could not avoid her for long. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Later that evening I was caled by my\n mother and father, and Grandma. I knew\n why. \n \n \n That night as I lay down to slep, I knew I\n could never steal again, not from\n \n grandma, not from my parents, and\n certainly not from anyone else. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 "
