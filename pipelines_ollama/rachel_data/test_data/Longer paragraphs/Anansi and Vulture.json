They lived in a peaceful vilage in \n the mountains. \n \n \n Rabit owned a big farm with lots of \n vegetables and fruit. \n \n \n Even though Rabit shared generously \n with his friend, Anansi was unhapy and \n \n jealous. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So Anansi thought of a clever plan to\n take over Rabit’s farm. \n \n \n Son Rabit was left por and homeles.\n Anansi was the proud owner of al\n \n Rabit’s land, vegetables, and fruit.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Anansi went to the market to sel his fruit \n and vegetables. \n \n \n He made so much money that he filed a \n big basket with it! \n \n \n With some of the money, he bought \n \n maize for his family, and put it on top of \n the money in the basket. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Anansi hapily headed home with his\n basket on his head, singing. \n \n \n He was thinking about al the things he\n was going to buy with his money.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n On the way it started to drizle. \n Son the drizle turned into a heavy \n downpour. \n \n \n Anansi the Spider left his basket on the \n side of the road to shelter under a tre. \n \n But from there he kept a close watch on \n his precious basket. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It started to rain even more heavily, and\n Anansi was geting cold and wet. So he\n ran into a hole. \n \n \n “I wil stay in this hole until the rain\n stops,” said Anansi to himself. “At least\n \n my money is protected by the maize I put\n on top of it.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A litle while later, Vulture was flying \n around and spoted the basket on the \n \n side of the road. \n \n He saw that there was money and maize \n \n in the basket. \n \n \n So he covered the basket with his wings \n and waited for the rain to stop. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Anansi saw Vulture siting on his basket.\n \n \n “Oh thank you, my friend, for protecting\n \n my basket,” he said to the Vulture.\n \n “Excuse me, Anansi, did I hear you right?”\n \n asked Vulture. “Your basket? This basket\n is mine! I found it here on the road side!”\n \n \n Anansi could not believe his ears! “It’s\n mine, I tel you!” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Furious, Anansi went and reported the\n theft to the chief. But Vulture said to the\n \n chief and his elders, “How could anyone\n leave a basket ful of money and maize\n unguarded on the road?” \n \n \n “But I was watching my basket,” said\n Anansi. “It’s my money and my maize!”\n \n \n “I was loking after the basket when you\n \n came and said it was yours!” replied\n Vulture. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When the chief and his elders had\n \n listened carefuly to both sides, they sent\n Anansi and Vulture away. \n \n \n They discused the story for a long time.\n \n \n Eventualy they reached a decision.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n They sumoned Anansi and the Vulture\n again. \n \n \n “We believe Vulture’s story,” they said.\n “He is not the thief. You were trying to\n \n claim something that was not yours.”\n \n \n Anansi could not believe his ears! He\n burst into tears. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The news son spread that the \n judgement had gone against Anansi.\n \n \n As he walked away, he heard Rabit\n laughing and laughing. \n \n \n Rabit went back to his farm and grew\n fruit and vegetables. \n \n \n But Anansi was por again, with no\n \n friends. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 "
