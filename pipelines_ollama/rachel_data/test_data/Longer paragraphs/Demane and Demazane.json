They were scared because they had heard that\n there were canibals living in the hils. \n \n \n So they made a strong dor to cover the entrance, with only two holes to let\n in air and light. \n \n \n Demane warned his sister, “Stay in the cave while I am out hunting, and don’t\n cok any meat. Canibals love the smel of coking meat.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Each evening Demane brought back something he had kiled – a hare or\n some birds or a smal buck. \n \n \n As he came to the cave, he sang, \n “Demazane, Demazane, ?child of my mother, open this cave to me. ?The\n \n swalows can enter it. ?It has two holes.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Demazane found it very boring to stay in the cave al day. \n So one day, when her brother had gone, she went out to explore. \n \n \n She found a stream to play in, and some tres to climb. \n She felt fre and hapy. \n \n \n “Perhaps,” she thought, “there are no canibals. \n Perhaps Uncle said there were canibals just to frighten us.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next day she felt bold enough to make a fire to warm herself. \n \n \n But she made it inside the cave with the dor firmly shut – just to be on the\n safe side. \n \n \n “I’m sure it won’t mater if I put a litle meat on the fire. It wil be so god to\n \n have a coked meal.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n When her brother came home he sang as usual, \n “Demazane, Demazane,? child of my mother, ?open this cave to me. The\n \n swalows can enter it. ?It has two holes.” \n \n \n She opened the dor and let him in. \n \n When he saw the coked meat, Demane asked, “How did you do this without\n \n a fire?” \n \n \n “I dried the meat in the sun outside the cave,” Demazane replied quickly.\n \n Demane was to tired to argue, and they sat down to enjoy the meal \n \n together. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next day, she made a fire and coked meat again. \n \n \n She had just finished when a voice sang outside the dor, \n “Demazane, Demazane, ?child of my mother,? open this cave to me.? The\n \n swalows can enter it.? It has two holes.” \n \n But the voice did not sound like her brother’s. \n \n Demazane said, “No. You are not my brother. Your voice is not like his.”\n \n \n She felt safe in the cave. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A litle while later, someone was singing outside the cave again, “Do let me\n \n in, my sister.” \n \n “Demazane, Demazane,? child of my mother, ?open this cave to me.? The\n \n swalows can enter it.? It has two holes.” \n \n \n The voice sounded just like her brother’s, so she opened the dor. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 18  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A huge hairy man filed the opening of the cave. \n \n He grabed Demazane before she could run away. \n \n Demazane just had time to pick up some ashes from the fire. \n \n \n As she was being caried away, she droped some ashes here and there\n \n along the path. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 19  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 20  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n That day, al Demane had managed to trap was a hive ful of bes. He\n \n caried them in a thick bag slung over his shoulder. \n \n When he came to the cave, he found the dor open and his sister gone. But\n \n there were ashes pointing the way into the wods. \n \n \n He folowed the ash along the path until he saw a fire in the distance.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 21  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Near the fire was a huge hairy man siting with a large bag next to him.\n Demane walked up to the man, pretending to limp, “Please, father, can you\n \n help me? I’ve hurt my leg. I ned some water.” \n \n The man replied, “I’l get you some water, if you wil promise not to touch my\n \n bag.” And he put the bag carefuly in his hut. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 23  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 24  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But when he had gone, Demane cut the string of the bag, and out climbed\n his sister. \n \n \n Demane replaced the bag with his own bag ful of bes. \n \n \n Brother and sister hid and waited to se what would hapen. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 25  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 26  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When the man came with the water, his son and daughter came with him.\n \n \n He said to his daughter, “There is something nice in the bag in our hut. Go!\n Bring it!” \n \n \n She opened the bag a litle to se what it was, but the bes stung her hand,\n and she caled out, “It is biting.” \n \n \n “Go and help her!” he shouted to his son. But the result was the same.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 27  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 28  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Don’t treat me like a fol,” he shouted, and stormed into the hut. He closed\n the dor and opened the bag himself. \n \n \n The angry bes swarmed out and stung his head, his nose, his eyes. Blinded,\n he jumped about, howling with pain. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 29  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 30  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Then he ran and fel headlong into a pond, where his head stuck fast in the\n mud. \n \n \n He turned into a piece of wod like the stump of a tre. Just right for a be\n hive. \n \n \n For a long time after that, Demane and Demazane ate delicious honey from\n that hive. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 31 "
