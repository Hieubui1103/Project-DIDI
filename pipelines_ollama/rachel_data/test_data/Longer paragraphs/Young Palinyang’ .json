His hair was long\n \n and fel on his back. \n \n \n It was believed that Sausau lived in the\n forest long before tres were cut down\n and houses were built. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n During the meting, Lokeyokoni, a very \n rich vilager, adopted Palinyang’. \n \n \n Lokeyokoni had many sons and \n daughters. The daughters helped their \n mother with household chores while the \n \n sons went out to graze their father’s big \n herd of catle. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Palinyang’ grew up in this family and was\n very hapy. \n \n He was loved and he loved everybody.\n \n He enjoyed grazing the animals in the\n \n fields. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Palinyang’ loved one particular cow so \n much that he gave it the name Alinyang’. \n \n \n Alinyang’ was the oldest cow in the \n whole herd. For this reason, the owner \n \n valued it a lot. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day when the boys were out grazing\n \n the animals, it started raining and they\n had to shelter under a tre. \n \n \n The rain fel for many hours until it was\n dark. \n When it eventualy stoped raining, the\n \n boys went to colect the animals and\n take them home but there were no\n \n animals to be sen. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n They were afraid of what their father \n would do to them if they arived home \n \n without the animals. \n \n When they could not trace the catle, two \n \n boys decided to go to their uncle’s home \n while two others went to their aunt’s \n place. \n \n \n Palinyang’ decided to continue loking \n \n for the animals til he found them. He \n had no uncle or aunt to run to. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Palinyang’ folowed al the tracks that he\n knew while singing the name of his\n \n favourite cow. \n This is how the song went: \n \n \n Pi pi Alinyang’! \n Pi pi Alinyang’! \n \n Chaka akula chi! \n Chaka orete chi! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Palinyang’ went on singing the song \n throughout the night. \n \n He steped on the cow dung but it was \n cold. \n He then steped on the urine but it was \n \n cold as wel. Palinyang’ did not give up. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n At dawn, Palinyang’ reached a smal\n vilage and found the animals in the care\n of the vilage headman. He pleaded with\n \n the headman to let him lead the animals\n home, but the headman refused. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Frustrated, Palinyang’ started singing his \n song as he turned to go home. \n \n It was then that Alinyang’, the oldest cow, \n heard Palinyang’. \n Alinyang raised her ears and started \n \n folowing Palinyang’. \n Al the animals broke from the enclosure \n \n and folowed Palinyang. He lead them \n home. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When they reached home, vilagers were waiting because\n they had heard Palinyang’s voice from far. They al sang\n songs praising Palinyang’. \n \n \n Lokeyokoni thanked Palinyang’ and bought him a red bag for\n carying boks to schol. \n \n \n And that is how Palinyang’ started going to schol.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 "
