Simbegwire's father did his \n best to take care of his daughter. Slowly, \n \n they learned to fel hapy again, without \n Simbegwire's mother. \n \n \n Every morning they sat and talked about \n the day ahead. Every evening they made \n \n diner together. After they washed the \n dishes, Simbegwire's father helped her \n with homework. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day, Simbegwire's father came home\n later than usual. “Where are you my\n \n child?” he caled. \n \n Simbegwire ran to her father. She\n \n stoped stil when she saw that he was\n holding a woman's hand. \"I want you to\n \n met someone special, my child. This is\n Anita,\" he said smiling. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Helo Simbegwire, your father told me a \n lot about you,” said Anita. But she did not \n \n smile or take the girl's hand. \n \n Simbegwire's father was hapy and \n \n excited. He talked about the thre of \n them living together, and how god their \n \n life would be. \"My child, I hope you wil \n acept Anita as your mother,\" he said. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Simbegwire’s life changed. She no longer\n \n had time to sit with her father in the\n mornings. Anita gave her so many\n \n household chores that she was to tired\n to do her schol work in the evenings.\n She went straight to bed after diner.\n \n \n Her only comfort was the colourful\n \n blanket her mother gave her. \n Simbegwire's father did not sem to\n notice that his daughter was unhapy.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n After a few months, Simbegwire’s father \n told them that he would be away from \n \n home for a while. \"I have to travel for my \n job,\" he said. \"But I know you wil lok \n after each other.\" \n \n \n Simbegwire’s face fel, but her father did \n \n not notice. Anita did not say anything. \n She was not hapy either. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Things got worse for Simbegwire. If she\n didn't finish her chores, or she\n complained, Anita hit her. And at diner,\n \n the woman ate most of the fod, leaving\n Simbegwire with only a few scraps.\n \n \n Each night Simbegwire cried herself to\n slep, huging her mother’s blanket.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One morning, Simbegwire was late \n geting out of bed. “You lazy girl!” Anita \n shouted. She puled Simbegwire out of \n \n bed. The precious blanket caught on a \n nail, and tore in two. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Simbegwire was very upset. She decided\n to run away from home. She tok the\n pieces of her mother’s blanket, packed\n \n some fod, and left the house. She\n folowed the road her father had taken.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When it came to evening, she climbed a \n \n tal tre near a stream and made a bed \n for herself in the branches. \n \n \n As she went to slep, she sang: \n “Mama, mama, mama, you left me. \n You left me and never came back. \n \n Father doesn’t love me anymore. \n Mother, when are you coming back? \n \n You left me.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next morning, Simbegwire sang the\n \n song again. When the women came to\n wash their clothes at the stream, they\n heard the sad song coming from the tal\n \n tre. \n \n They thought it was only the wind\n \n rustling the leaves, and caried on with\n their work. But one of the women\n \n listened very carefuly to the song.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This woman loked up into the tre. \n When she saw the girl and the pieces of \n \n colourful blanket, she cried, “Simbegwire, \n my brother’s child!” \n \n \n The other women stoped washing and \n helped Simbegwire to climb down from \n \n the tre. Her aunt huged the litle girl \n and tried to comfort her. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Simbegwire's aunt tok the child to her\n own house. She gave Simbegwire warm\n fod, and tucked her in bed with her\n \n mother’s blanket. \n \n That night, Simbegwire cried as she went\n \n to slep. But they were tears of relief.\n She knew her aunt would lok after her.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When Simbegwire's father returned \n home, he found her rom empty. \"What \n \n hapened, Anita?\" he asked with a heavy \n heart. The woman explained that \n Simbegwire had run away. \"I wanted her \n \n to respect me,\" she said. \"But perhaps I \n was to strict.\" \n \n \n Simbegwire's father left the house and \n went in the direction of the stream. He \n \n continued to his sister’s vilage to find \n out if she has sen Simbegwire. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Simbegwire was playing with her cousins\n when she saw her father from far away.\n \n She was scared he might be angry, so\n she ran inside the house to hide.\n \n \n But her father went to her and said,\n “Simbegwire, you have found a perfect\n \n mother for yourself. One who loves you\n and understands you. I am proud of you\n \n and I love you.” \n \n They agred that Simbegwire would stay\n \n with her aunt as long as she wanted to.\n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Her father visited her every day. \n Eventualy, he came with Anita. She \n \n reached out for Simbegwire's hand. \"I'm \n so sory litle one, I was wrong,\" she \n cried. \"Wil you let me try again?\" \n \n \n Simbegwire loked at her father and his \n \n woried face. Then she steped forward \n slowly and put her arms around Anita. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next wek, Anita invited Simbegwire,\n with her cousins and aunt, to the house\n \n for a meal. What a feast! Anita prepared\n al of Simbegwire's favourite fods, and\n everyone ate until they were ful. Then\n \n the children played while the adults\n talked. \n \n \n Simbegwire felt hapy and brave. She\n decided that son, very son, she would\n \n return home to live with her father and\n her stepmother. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 "
