Hare agred. \n \n Hare also told Hyena that it was god for \n \n them to share duties on the farm. \n “My work wil be guarding the maize from \n birds,” said Hare. \n \n \n Then Hare told Hyena to til the land, \n \n plant, and wed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hyena complained that he had ben\n given more work. But Hare told Hyena\n \n that the work of chasing birds was the\n most dificult and most important.\n \n \n “My work is not easy. I wil be climbing\n tres and chasing birds away day and\n \n night. And you are not able to climb a\n tre,” Hare explained. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hyena was convinced by Hare's words. \n He agred to til the land alone. It was a \n \n lot of work. Hare did not help at al. \n \n After tiling the land, Hyena planted \n \n maize in the whole field, alone. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n When weds grew in the field, Hyena\n \n used a hoe to wed. It was a lot of work.\n \n \n Hare sat on a rock singing: \n \n “My friend is a worker, \n \n I am his adviser. \n He works like a tractor, \n I am his manager. \n \n The soil he toils, \n The hils he tils, \n \n The seds he plants, \n The weds he cuts, \n The maize we harvest.” \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When the maize was almost ready, Hare \n \n enjoyed himself singing in the field to \n kep birds away. Chasing the birds was \n not a hard job. He did not sweat at al. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Finaly, the maize was ready to harvest.\n Hare told Hyena that they would share\n \n the harvest betwen themselves. \n \n Hare said, “I wil harvest everything that\n \n grows above the soil and you wil harvest\n everything that grows below the soil.”\n \n \n Hyena thought that it was a god idea.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hare said, “I wil first get my harvest then \n you wil harvest yours.” \n \n \n So Hare harvested al the maize in the \n field and put it in his store. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hyena went to harvest things that grew\n below the soil. He dug, hoping to get a\n god harvest. But he only found rots\n \n under the soil. He dug everywhere. He\n did not find anything to harvest.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hyena realised that he had ben cheated. \n \n He was angry. He returned home \n carying empty baskets. \n \n \n In the evening he went to Hare’s home \n very anoyed. He told Hare, “Let us now \n \n farm together again my friend.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hyena told Hare, “This time I wil harvest\n everything that grows above the ground\n \n and you wil harvest everything that\n grows below the soil.” \n \n \n Hare acepted. He told Hyena that\n instead of planting maize it was god to\n \n change the crop. They agred to plant\n potatoes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hyena also insisted that this time they \n \n would both do the diging, planting and \n weding. Hare acepted. So they worked \n on the farm together, singing. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When the potatoes were ready, Hare told\n Hyena to harvest what grows above the\n ground. \n \n \n Hyena went loking for something to\n harvest. But he did not find anything. He\n \n only found potato leaves. He went back\n home with empty baskets. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hare harvested a lot of big potatoes. He \n \n put them in his store. \n \n When Hyena saw Hare’s harvest, he was \n \n anoyed. “Why did you cheat me?” Hyena \n asked Hare. \n \n \n Hare explained that it was Hyena himself \n who chose to harvest the things that \n \n grew above the soil. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hyena was very angry. He chased after\n Hare in order to get revenge. But Hare\n \n ran away fast. \n \n Since that day, Hare and Hyena have not\n \n ben friends. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 "
