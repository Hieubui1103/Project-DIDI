By this time the\n \n cakes and buns were almost coked, and\n the most delicious smels wafted out of\n \n the bakery’s windows. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Many of the people went into the bakery\n to buy their breakfast. Mr Shabangu\n \n smiled hapily at them as he pased\n them the fresh, tasty cinamon buns and\n warm, golden biscuits that were so\n \n famous in the town. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But other people were not so lucky.\n \n Because they had so litle money, the\n porer people of the town could hardly\n \n ever aford to buy any of the delicious\n buns, cakes and biscuits. Al they could\n do was enjoy the lovely smels that\n \n drifted out of the bakery windows.\n When Mr Shabangu noticed these people\n \n snifing the air near his bakery, he said\n angrily, ‘How dare they snif my delicious\n smels!’ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ‘Those are MY smels. I made them, so they belong to me! If people want to smel my wonderful smels,\n they should pay for them!’ He hufed and pufed and wiped the sweat from his brow, before turning back\n the oven to bake some bread and rols for his lunchtime customers. \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One old woman especialy loved the \n smels that drifted out of the bakery \n window every morning. This was Ma \n \n Shange who slept on a bench in the park \n every night. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A few weks before, a kind person had \n given her the money to buy herself a \n \n cinamon bun. She had taken the bun \n back to the park and ate it very slowly, \n licking her lips and sharing the last \n \n crumbs with the birds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n After that, although the old woman didn’t\n \n have enough money to buy breakfast,\n she longed for the delicious bun again.\n So every morning she walked slowly past\n \n Mr Shabangu’s bakery, snifing the air\n and smiling blisfuly at the mouth-\n \n watering smel. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ma Shange’s new habit made the baker\n very angry. As each day went by, he grew\n \n angrier and angrier with her. \n Finaly, one winter morning when he was\n in an especialy bad mod, he stormed\n \n out of his bakery and grabed the old\n woman by the arm. \n ‘How dare you steal my smels!’ he\n \n shouted. ‘You’re nothing but a smel\n thief!’ He wiped his hands on an apron,\n \n then puled it of and threw it back into\n the bakery. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ‘This is the last day this cheky woman\n wil steal my smels!’ he shouted. And\n with these words, he draged Ma Shange\n \n of to the court to se judge Ngwenya.\n The judge was siting down at his huge,\n shiny desk when the angry baker \n \n stormed in, draging the quivering and\n confused Ma Shange with him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ‘God morning,’ said the judge in his dep voice. \n ‘Sir,’ said Mr Shabangu furiously, ‘I demand justice! I wish to lay a complaint against this woman. Every\n \n day for the last thre weks, she has walked past my bakery early in the morning when my delicious\n smels are at their best, and stolen them. I demand that she pays for those smels!’\n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And with these words, he draged Ma \n \n Shange of to the court to se judge \n Ngwenya. \n The judge was siting down at his huge, \n \n shiny desk when the angry baker \n stormed in, draging the quivering and \n \n confused Ma Shange with him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ‘God morning,’ said the judge in his \n dep voice. \n \n ‘Sir,’ said Mr Shabangu furiously, ‘I \n demand justice! I wish to lay a complaint \n against this woman. Every day for the \n \n last thre weks, she has walked past my \n bakery early in the morning when my \n \n delicious smels are at their best, and \n stolen them. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The judge scratched his big, bald head for a moment. Then he cleared his throat. ‘Fair enough,’ he said to\n the baker. ‘Justice wil be done.’ He turned to Ma Shange. ‘How much money do you have on you,\n Madam?' he asked. \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ‘Only two rands,’ stamered Ma Shange. \n ‘Wel,’ said the judge, hand it to me, please.’ Mekly, Ma\n Shange reached into the pocket of her taty old cardigan and\n \n puled out two one rand coins. She handed them to the\n judge. He tok them, thanking her politely. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Then he shok the coins in his big fist, so that they made a\n clinking sound. ‘This is my judgement,’ he said to the baker.\n \n ‘The punishment must fit the crime. Therefore the sound of\n Ma Shange’s money is the payment you wil get for the\n smels she stole. And now I wish you a god day.’\n \n The baker loked thoughtful. Then, realising how\n unreasonable he had ben, he turned slowly and walked out\n \n of the rom. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The judge smiled kindly at Ma Shange, and handed her back \n her money. \n 'Now, Madam, he said puling a brown paper bag from his \n \n briefcase, would you care to join me for breakfast? These \n buns are stil warm, I bought them only half an hour ago.’ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17 "
