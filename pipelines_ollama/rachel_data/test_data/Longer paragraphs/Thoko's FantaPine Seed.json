He wanted it to last\n him until they got to the top of the hil.\n \n At the top of the hil his father stoped to\n give the oxen a rest. \n “What a beautiful valey we live in\n \n children,” he said. \n “We are lucky to live in such a clean,\n \n fresh place.” He smiled. \n On they went. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n The sun was warm. \n \n The wagon was rocking gently from side \n to side as the oxen walked. \n \n The children were chating softly to each \n other. \n Thoko felt slepy. \n \n He wanted to lie down on the mielies and \n slep a litle. \n He loked at the empty FantaPine tin in \n \n his hand. \n “I am tired of holding this empty tin,” he \n \n thought to himself. \n What can I do with it?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Thoko thought for a minute. \n \n Then he threw that FantaPine tin as far\n as he could out into the field. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Whe! That tin flew over the \n field. \n \n Twok! It landed in one of the furows. \n The children laughed. \n “Aie, Thoko is god at throwing!” they \n \n said. \n “Lok how far he threw that FantaPine \n \n tin!” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Thoko’s father turned around. \n \n He stoped the wagon. \n “What did you throw into my field\n \n Thoko?” he asked. \n “I threw my FantaPine tin father,” said\n Thoko. \n \n “Why did you do that Thoko?” asked his\n father. \n \n “I was tired of holding it, and it made my\n fingers sticky,” said Thoko. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Let me ask you something, Thoko,” said \n his father. \n \n “Do I grow FantaPine in my fields?” \n “Hahahahahahaha,” the children laughed. \n “Aie, no, no, no, of course not father,” \n \n Thoko said. \n “Have you sen FantaPine growing on \n the stalks in the sumer Thoko?” \n \n “ Hehahahahahaha,” laughed the \n children. \n \n “No father, never,” said Thoko. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Have you sen us harvesting FantaPine\n in winter in my fields Thoko?” asked his\n \n father. \n “Who, he, ha, ha, ha!” laughed\n the children. \n \n “No father, we do not,” said Thoko.\n “Do you se us taking FantaPine tins\n home on my wagon to eat?” his father\n \n went on. \n “Absolutely not, my father,” said Thoko.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Does your mother grind FantaPine tins \n \n to make sorghum poridge Thoko?” \n The children were laughing so much they \n had to hold onto the sides of the wagon. \n \n But Thoko could se that his father was \n not hapy. \n \n “Never father.” said Thoko. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “So Thoko, answer me please,” said his\n father. “What do I grow in my fields?”\n \n “You grow corn and sorghum in your\n fields father,” answered Thoko. \n “Yes,” said Thoko’s father, “you are right.\n \n So I am asking myself a question. Why is\n my son planting FantaPine tins in my\n \n field, when he knows very wel that I grow\n only corn and sorghum?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The children stoped laughing. \n There was silence on the wagon. \n \n Thoko loked at his father. \n His father was frowning. \n He said, “Thoko, you get down of this \n \n wagon right now. \n You go and find that FantaPine tin and \n \n you bring it back here at once!” \n He spoke in a big, loud voice. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n Thoko felt ashamed. \n \n He got down of the wagon and went into\n the field. \n \n He loked for his empty FantaPine tin.\n There it was, shining in the sun.\n He walked over to it. \n \n Just as he was about to pick it up, he\n noticed a dirty plastic bag lying nearby.\n Thoko stoped and thought about that\n \n plastic bag. \n Then he walked over to it and picked it\n \n up. \n He went back to the wagon. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n His father was waiting for him. \n “What have you got there, Thoko?” he \n \n asked. \n “I have my FantaPine tin and a plastic \n \n bag father, he said. \n \"I se,” said his father. \n \"Yes,” said Thoko. \n \n ”I said to myself, my father grows only \n corn and sorghum in his fields. \n \n He does not grow FantaPine drinks, and \n he also does not grow plastic bags in his \n fields.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Thoko, I am very proud of you my son,”\n said his father. \n “Children, let’s al go into the field. We wil\n \n se if there are other plastic bags, and\n tins and other things that we don’t grow\n there,” he said. \n \n “Mm, god idea!” said Thoko. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The children claped their hands and \n \n jumped down of the wagon. \n They ran into the field. \n They found many plastic bags, papers, \n \n tins and boxes there. \n “These must not be planted in the fields,” \n they said. \n \n When they came back to the wagon, their \n arms were ful of al the rubish. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Put them al here children,\" said Thoko’s\n \n father. \n \"We wil take them home and burn them.\n We do not want these things in our fields.\n \n These things we canot grow. These\n things are not god for our soil.\"\n \"Yes, yes!\" said the children.\n \n \n Everybody got back onto the wagon.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Thoko’s father whistled to the oxen. \n The wagon began to move again. \n “Thoko,’ said his father, ‘tel me, do you \n \n think our fields are hapy now?’ \n ‘Yes, father,’ said Thoko, smiling. ‘And me \n to, I am hapy now.’ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 18 "
