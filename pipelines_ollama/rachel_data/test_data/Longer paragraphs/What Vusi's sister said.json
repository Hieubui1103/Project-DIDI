They want to make a large cake\n for your sister’s weding”. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n On his way to his parents, Vusi met two \n \n boys picking fruit. One boy grabed the \n eg from Vusi and shot it at a tre. The \n eg broke. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “What have you done?” cried Vusi.\n \n “That eg was for a cake. The cake was\n for my sister’s weding. What wil my\n sister say if there is no weding cake?”\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The boys were sory for teasing Vusi. \n \n “We can’t help with the cake, but here is a \n walking stick for your sister,” said one. \n Vusi continued on his journey. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Along the way he met two men building a\n house. “Can we use that strong stick?”\n asked one. \n \n But the stick was not strong enough for\n building, and it broke. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “What have you done?” cried Vusi. \n \n “That stick was a gift for my sister. The \n fruit pickers gave me the stick because \n they broke the eg for the cake. The cake \n \n was for my sister’s weding. Now there \n is no eg, no cake, and no gift. What wil \n \n my sister say?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The builders were sory for breaking the\n stick. \n “We can’t help with the cake, but here is\n \n some thatch for your sister,” said one.\n And so Vusi continued on his journey.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Along the way, Vusi met a farmer and a \n cow. “What delicious thatch, can I have a \n nible?” asked the cow. \n \n But the thatch was so tasty that the cow \n ate it al! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “What have you done?” cried Vusi.\n \n “That thatch was a gift for my sister. The\n builders gave me the thatch because\n they broke the stick from the fruit\n \n pickers. The fruit pickers gave me the\n stick because they broke the eg for my\n sister’s cake. The cake was for my\n \n sister’s weding. Now there is no eg, no\n cake, and no gift. What wil my sister\n \n say?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The cow was sory she was gredy. The \n \n farmer agred that the cow could go with \n Vusi as a gift for his sister. And so Vusi \n caried on. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But the cow ran back to the farmer at\n super time. \n \n And Vusi got lost on his journey.\n He arived very late for his sister’s\n weding. The guests were already\n \n eating. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “What shal I do?” cried Vusi. \n \n “The cow that ran away was a gift, in \n return for the thatch the builders gave \n me. The builders gave me the thatch \n \n because they broke the stick from the \n fruit pickers. The fruit pickers gave me \n the stick because they broke the eg for \n \n the cake. The cake was for the weding. \n Now there is no eg, no cake, and no \n \n gift.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Vusi’s sister thought for a while, then she\n said, \n “Vusi my brother, I don’t realy care about\n \n gifts. I don’t even care about the cake!\n We are al here together, I am hapy. Now\n put on your smart clothes and let’s\n \n celebrate this day!” \n And so that’s what Vusi did. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13 "
