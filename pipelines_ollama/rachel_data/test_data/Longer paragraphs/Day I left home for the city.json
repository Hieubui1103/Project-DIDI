City! Going west!” I heard a tout\n shouting. \n \n That was the bus I neded to catch.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The city bus was almost ful, but more \n people were stil pushing to get on. \n Some packed their lugage under the \n \n bus. Others put theirs on the racks \n inside. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n New pasengers clutched their tickets as\n they loked for somewhere to sit in the\n crowded bus. \n \n Women with young children made them\n comfortable for the long journey.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I squezed in next to a window. \n The person siting next to me was\n holding tightly to a gren plastic bag.\n \n He wore old sandals, a worn out coat,\n and he loked nervous. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I loked outside the bus and realised that \n \n I was leaving my vilage, the place where \n I had grown up. \n I was going to the big city. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The loading was completed and al\n \n pasengers were seated. \n Hawkers stil pushed their way into the\n bus to sel their gods to the pasengers.\n \n Each one was shouting the names of\n what was available for sale. The words\n \n sounded funy to me. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A few pasengers bought drinks, others \n \n bought smal snacks and began to chew. \n Those who did not have any money, like \n me, just watched. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n These activities were interupted by the\n \n hoting of the bus, a sign that we were\n ready to leave. \n The tout yeled at the hawkers to get out.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hawkers pushed each other to make \n their way out of the bus. Some gave back \n change to the travelers. \n \n Others made last minute atempts to sel \n more items. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As the bus left the bus stop, I stared out\n \n of the window. \n I wondered if I would ever go back to my\n vilage again. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As the journey progresed, the inside of \n the bus got very hot. \n \n I closed my eyes hoping to slep. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But my mind drifted back home. \n Wil my mother be safe? \n Wil my rabits fetch any money?\n \n Wil my brother remember to water my\n tre sedlings? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n On the way, I memorised the name of the \n place where my uncle lived in the big city. \n \n I was stil mumbling it when I fel aslep. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nine hours later, I woke up with loud\n banging and caling for pasengers going\n back to my vilage. \n \n I grabed my smal bag and jumped out\n of the bus. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The return bus was filing up quickly. \n Son it would make its way back east. \n The most important thing for me now, \n \n was to start loking for my uncle’s \n house. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 "
