He lived in a palace with the \n \n quen and their daughter, princes \n Apenyo. \n \n \n Princes Apenyo was such a beautiful \n young woman that every man wanted to \n \n mary her. But king Kayanja demanded a \n very high bride price for the princes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Near king Kayanja’s palace lived a chief\n caled Aludah the Great. He was caled\n \n “the Great” because everybody in the\n neighbourhod obeyed him. (He was\n very violent to anyone who disobeyed\n \n him!) \n \n \n Chief Aludah’s wife had recently died of\n malaria and he wanted another wife.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So the fat old chief went to king Kayanja \n to ofer bride wealth for the young \n princes. \n \n \n While the two men were discusing the \n price, the maid Kakembo overheard their \n \n conversation. Maid Kakembo was very \n close to princes Apenyo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Chief Aludah agred to give half of his\n \n wealth to king Kayanja, including a\n nedle, which was also part of the bride\n price. \n \n \n Preparations were made in secret for the\n weding betwen chief Aludah and\n \n princes Apenyo. The king knew that his\n daughter would not be hapy with this\n \n decision. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One wek before the royal weding day, \n \n maid Kakembo aproached Apenyo. \n \n “My dear princes, your father has \n \n organised your weding with Chief \n Aludah, and it wil take place in one \n \n wek,” said Kakembo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Princes Apenyo was shocked and at\n first didn’t know what to do. Then she\n thought, “I wil never mary chief Aludah,\n \n that fat old man. Never! I must hury to\n Trevor and se what he can do before it’s\n to late.” \n \n \n Trevor was princes Apenyo’s boyfriend.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n That night Apenyo crept out of the \n palace. If her father discovered where \n \n she was going he would be very angry. \n \n She ran through the thick, dark forest \n \n over rocks and shrubs, until she finaly \n reached her Trevor. When she arived at \n \n his house she was tired, hungry, and \n thirsty. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “My love, why have you run al this long\n \n distance alone and at such a time of\n night?” asked Trevor. He fetched drinking\n water for her and alowed her to rest.\n \n \n Trevor could not setle down while he\n \n waited for Apenyo to talk. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “My dear princes, what is the problem?” \n asked Trevor. \n \n \n Apenyo breathed heavily and said sadly, \n “My father wants to mary me of to chief \n \n Aludah the Great. But I can’t mary that \n horible man. Trevor, I want to mary you \n \n even if you are por. I am ready to sufer. \n I love you.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “But princes, I have nothing to pay as\n your bride price, you know I’m a por\n \n boy.” cried Trevor. \n \n Apenyo replied, “I know, but it’s only you I\n \n can get maried to.” \n \n She thought for a while and said, “Let’s\n \n go to Katega the boat man to sail us to\n the other side of the river. That way we\n \n can escape and my father wil never find\n us.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n Back at the palace, king Kayanja had \n \n discovered Princes Apenyo’s \n disapearance and ordered his subjects \n \n to search for her everywhere in the \n vilage. \n \n \n The king’s guards, soldiers, and everyone \n else searched, but they couldn’t find \n Princes Apenyo. \n \n \n They went back to the King and told him \n \n Apenyo was nowhere to be sen. “Then \n go to the bush and search,” King Kayanja \n ordered. He was very anoyed. \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As Princes Apenyo and Trevor huried to\n \n the riverbank, dark clouds began\n gathering in the sky. A heavy storm was\n coming. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Katega the boatman was moring his \n boat when the young couple aproached \n him. Trevor asked Katega to row them \n \n acros the river. \n \n Katega refused to acept, explaining \n \n that a heavy storm was fast aproaching, \n and it would be to dangerous. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Trevor insisted and explained to Katega\n why they must cros. He then put his\n \n hand dep in his pocket and tok out a\n cowrie shel to give to Katega.\n \n \n When Katega heard their story and saw\n the beautiful shel, he felt sory for them.\n \n He agred to row them acros the river in\n spite of the weather. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Katega puled the boat near the bank \n and told them to get in. He then picked \n his oars and began rowing. \n \n \n When king Kayanja and chief Aludah \n reached the bank, they saw the thre \n \n people in the boat. They realised that the \n young lovers had escaped. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Heavy winds rocked the boat and \n Katega could no longer control it. King\n \n Kayanja shouted: “Apenyo, please come\n back! I have forgiven you and wil never\n \n punish you or Trevor.” \n \n But it was to late. The boat tiped over\n \n and the thre people were thrown into\n the wild water. They al drowned.\n \n \n After that day, everyone in king Kayanja’s\n kingdom could mary anyone they \n \n wanted, rich or por. \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 "
