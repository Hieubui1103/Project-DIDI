Most people use \n \n bicycles for transport. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One morning my mother caled me and said, “Etabo, today\n you turn six years old. We have a present for you.”\n \n \n “What is it? What is it?” I asked eagerly. \n \n \n “Tomorow we’re going by bus to the market in Eldoret,” she\n replied, “And we’re taking you with us!” \n \n \n My first visit to the city! I was so excited that I could hardly\n slep that night. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next day at the Kakuma bus stop, I \n \n stod betwen my mother and my aunt \n in my new pair of blue jeans and red T- \n shirt. \n \n \n I felt very smal betwen my tal slender \n \n mother and my big round aunt. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The bus was very ful, so I had to sit on\n \n my mother’s lap. \n \n Tired from the heat and excitement, I\n \n slept the whole way and saw nothing.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The sun was just rising when we reached Eldoret market. \n \n At the entrance was a woman seling grains. Over in one \n \n corner there were two men geting ready to lay out their \n swet potatoes. \n \n \n Over in another corner was a short woman holding a shiny \n blue helicopter. \n \n “Mother, mother, lok at that helicopter!” But mother puled \n me away. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In the midle of the market, there was a large stal that sold\n diferent types of fruit. \n Some of them I had never sen before. \n \n \n “What are the names of these fruits?” I asked my mother.\n She pointed at some: “These are oranges, and these are\n \n guavas.” \n \n \n I turned around and said, “And these?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Of al the fruits at the stal, I liked the \n aples most. I liked their shape and \n colour. I wondered how they tasted. \n \n I turned to mother and said, “Could you \n buy one for me?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As son as she gave me the aple, I let\n \n go of my mother’s hand, tok the fruit\n with both hands, and bit into the juicy\n flesh. \n \n I had never enjoyed a fruit the way I\n enjoyed that aple. \n \n Al I cared about was my aple. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When I finished the aple, I loked up to talk to my mother. \n But she was not there! I loked where we had come from, \n \n but my mother and aunt were not there. \n \n I loked to the right, then to the left. But they were nowhere \n \n to be sen. “Have you sen my mother?” I asked the women \n seling potatoes nearby. They tok no notice. I started to cry. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A while later, a woman tok me by the\n hand and led me to a place where there\n \n were other children. \n A big man with a thick beard asked,\n “What’s your name, boy?” \n \n “E-ta-bo,” I replied through my tears.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n I wondered if children were also sold at \n the market. I stoped crying and loked \n \n around to se if anyone would buy the \n children in the rom. Son a woman \n came in and picked up one of the \n \n children. \n “I wil be the next one to be taken away,” I \n \n thought. “And then I’l never go home \n again!” \n I started crying once more. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When I heard the big man with the thick\n beard saying, “Where is Etabo?” I cried\n \n even harder. \n “But I do not want to go with you!” I\n sobed. \n \n I ran away from him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When my mother and aunt heard my \n \n name, they rushed to the rom. \n “Etabo, Etabo!” a familiar voice caled. \n It was my mother. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As I got up to hug my mother, my aunt\n said, “Etabo, we were loking for you to\n \n give you your birthday present.”\n And from a big bag, she puled out a\n shiny blue helicopter. \n \n “It’s yours!” she said. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14 "
