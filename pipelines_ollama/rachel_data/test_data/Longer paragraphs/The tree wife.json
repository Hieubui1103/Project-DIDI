He did not have a wife.\n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Standing under a tre one day, he had a\n briliant idea. \n \n \n If he couldn’t find a wife, perhaps he\n could make one? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So he set to work to shape a beautiful\n woman from a strong branch of the tre.\n \n When he had finished making the statue,\n he touched her eyes, and they opened.\n He blew gently on her, and she came\n \n alive. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n She was truly the most beautiful woman \n he had ever sen. \n \n \n He knelt before her, and asked her to be \n his wife. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He gave her a colourful apron, beads,\n and a head ring, the sign of a maried\n \n woman. And he built her a house with the\n mud and gras that used to lie at the fot\n of her trunk. \n \n \n “Only one thing I beg of you,” he said to\n \n his wife. “Never tel anyone where you\n come from.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But before long, the young men from a \n \n neighbouring vilage began talking \n among themselves. \n “How can such an old man have such a \n \n beautiful young wife?” \n So they decided to steal her and take her \n \n to their own kral. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The old man was heartbroken. He felt he\n \n could not live without her. \n \n But then he thought, “Perhaps if I have\n \n something of hers, I would not fel so\n sad?” \n \n \n So he sent his doves to find her, to sing\n to her, and to bring back something of\n \n hers to him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When they found her, they sang to her in\n \n the language of birds: \n \n Tre woman, tre woman \n \n More beautiful than any other \n Your husband has sent us \n \n To bring back your apron! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n She gave them her apron, and they flew over the hil, over the river, back to her husband. He held the\n \n apron to his face, and was comforted for a litle while. \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But his longing did not go away.\n \n So again he sent his doves to sing to her:\n \n Tre woman, tre woman \n \n More beautiful than any other \n Your husband has sent us \n To bring back your head ring! \n \n \n And back they flew with the head ring,\n \n the sign of a maried woman. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He held the head ring and sighed for his\n \n wife, far away in the kral of other\n people. \n \n \n After a while, he caled his doves again.\n He told them to go to her and sing:\n \n \n Tre woman, tre woman \n \n More beautiful than any other \n Your husband has sent us \n To bring back your life! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So away they went the third time. \n \n They perched on her shoulders. As they \n sang, each bird pecked out an eye. \n \n \n Imediately she turned again into a \n statue. Her fet and arms fel away. Then \n \n her head. And she fel to the ground. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Her husband slowly roled her woden\n trunk to the river. He stod her up with\n her rots in the water. Nourished by sun\n \n and soil, she grew leaves again.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And when the wind blows, the leaves \n sigh. \n \n \n Just as a woman does when she longs \n for her husband. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14 "
