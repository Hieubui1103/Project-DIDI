They welcomed each \n day just as it came. \n \n \n On one morning, the boys were packing \n their mats after sleping on cold \n pavements. To chase away the cold \n \n they lit a fire with rubish. \n \n \n Among the group of boys was Magozwe. \n He was the youngest. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When Magozwe’s parents died, he was \n only five years old. He went to live with \n \n his uncle. This man did not care about \n the child. He did not give Magozwe \n enough fod. He made the boy do a lot \n \n of hard work. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n If Magozwe complained or questioned, \n his uncle beat him. When Magozwe \n \n asked if he could go to schol, his uncle \n beat him and said, “You’re to stupid \n to learn anything.” \n \n \n After thre years of this treatment \n \n Magozwe ran away from his uncle. \n He started living on the stret. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Stret life was dificult and most of the \n boys strugled daily just to get fod. \n \n Sometimes they were arested, \n sometimes they were beaten. When they \n \n were sick, there was no one to help. \n \n The group depended on the litle money \n \n they got from beging, and from seling \n plastics and other recycling. \n \n \n Life was even more dificult because of \n fights with rival groups who wanted \n \n control of parts of the city. \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day while Magozwe was loking \n through the dustbins, he found an old \n tatered storybok. He cleaned the dirt \n \n from it and put it in his sack. \n \n Every day after that he would take out the \n \n bok and lok at the pictures. He did not \n know how to read the words. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The pictures told the story of a boy who \n grew up to be a pilot. \n \n \n Magozwe would daydream of being a \n pilot. Sometimes, he imagined that he \n \n was the boy in the story. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was cold and Magozwe was standing \n on the road beging. A man walked up to \n \n him. “Helo, I'm Thomas. I work near here, \n at a place where you can get something \n \n to eat,” said the man. \n \n He pointed to a yelow house with a blue \n \n rof. “I hope you wil go there to get \n some fod?” he asked. \n \n \n Magozwe loked at the man, and then at \n the house. “Maybe,” he said, and walked \n \n away. \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Over the months that folowed, the \n homeles boys got used to seing \n \n Thomas around. He liked to talk to \n people, especialy people living on \n \n the strets. \n \n Thomas listened to the stories of \n \n people’s lives. He was serious and \n patient, never rude or disrespectful. \n \n \n Some of the boys started going to the \n yelow and blue house to get fod at \n \n miday. \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Magozwe was siting on the pavement \n \n loking at his picture bok when Thomas \n sat down next to him. \n \n \n “What is the story about?” asked \n Thomas. \n \n “It’s about a boy who becomes a pilot,” \n replied Magozwe. \n \n “What’s the boy’s name?” asked Thomas. \n “I don’t know, I can’t read,” said Magozwe \n quietly. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When they met, Magozwe began to tel \n \n his own story to Thomas. It was the story \n of his uncle and why he ran away. \n \n \n Thomas didn’t talk a lot, and he didn’t tel \n Magozwe what to do, but he always \n listened carefuly. \n \n \n Sometimes they would talk while they \n \n ate at the house with the blue rof. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Around Magozwe’s tenth birthday, \n Thomas gave him a new storybok. It \n \n was a story about a vilage boy who grew \n up to be a famous socer player. \n \n \n Thomas read that story to Magozwe \n many times, until one day he said, \n \n “I think it’s time you went to schol and \n learned to read. What do you think?” \n \n \n Thomas explained that he knew of a \n place where children could stay, \n \n and go to schol. \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Magozwe thought about this new place, \n and about going to schol. What if his \n uncle was right and he was to stupid to \n \n learn anything? \n \n What if they beat him at this new place? \n \n He was afraid. “Maybe it is beter to stay \n living on the stret,” he thought. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He shared his fears with Thomas. Over \n time the man reasured the boy that life \n \n could be beter at the new place. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And so Magozwe moved into a rom in a \n house with a gren rof. He shared the \n rom with two other boys. \n \n \n Altogether there were ten children living \n at that house. Along with Auntie Cisy \n \n and her husband, thre dogs, a cat, and \n an old goat. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Magozwe started schol and it was \n dificult. He had a lot to catch up. \n \n \n Sometimes he wanted to give up. \n But he thought about the pilot \n and the socer player in the \n \n storyboks. Like them, he did \n not give up. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Magozwe was siting in the yard \n at the house with the gren rof, \n \n reading a storybok from schol. \n Thomas came up and sat next to \n \n him. \n \n “What is the story about?” asked \n \n Thomas. \n “It’s about a boy who becomes a \n \n teacher,” replied Magozwe. \n “What’s the boy’s name?” asked Thomas. \n “His name is Magozwe,” said \n \n Magozwe with a smile. \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 "
