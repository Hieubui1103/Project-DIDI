After her father died, she\n lived alone with her mother. \n \n \n One day her mother decided that they\n would move to another vilage to start a\n \n new life.Tselane did not want to leave\n her old vilage and she started to cry.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Her mother was scared to leave her \n daughter alone because giants lived in \n \n the caves nearby that vilage. \n \n But Tselane cried so much that her \n \n mother finaly agred that she could stay \n behind. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tselane’s mother told her that she would \n bring fod every day. She said, \n \n “I wil sing a song so that you know it’s \n me. Don’t open the dor for anyone else, \n \n my child.” \n \n She sang the song: \n \n \"Tselane my child! \n Tselane my child! \n \n Come out and eat your poridge! \n Come out and eat your poridge!\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next morning Tselane’s mother came \n \n to the house with fod. She sang their \n special song. Tselane opened the dor \n and tok her mother’s delicious fod. \n \n \n Then her mother kised her and went \n \n back to her new home. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A giant was hiding in the bushes,\n watching and listening to Tselane and\n \n her mother! \n \n After Tselane switched of her light that\n \n night, she heard a dep voice singing her\n mother’s song outside the dor. \n \"Tselane my child! Come out and eat\n \n your poridge!\" sang the giant. \n \n \n “Go away! You are not my mother! You\n are a giant!” shouted Tselane. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The giant walked away disapointed and \n \n disapeared into the caves. \n \n Every morning and every evening, \n \n Tselane’s mother brought her fod. \n \n Every morning and every evening, the \n \n giant also came. But each time Tselane \n sent him away. She recognised his dep \n \n voice as he sang her mother’s song. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day the giant had an idea. “I can \n \n change my voice to resemble that of \n Tselane’s mother!” he said to himself. \n \n \n He made a fire and threw a round \n smoth stone into the flames. When the \n \n stone was very hot and red, he tok it out \n of the fire and swalowed it! \n \n \n “Kudutlu!” went the hot stone down the \n throat of the giant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The giant started singing. He jumped for\n joy when he heard his voice sounding as\n \n swet as that of Tselane’s mother!\n \n Early the next day, the giant went to\n \n Tselane’s house early in the morning.\n When he got to the dor of the house, he\n sang: \n \n \"Tselane my child! \n Tselane my child! \n \n Come out and eat your poridge! \n Come out and eat your poridge!\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tselane was excited to hear her mother’s \n voice. She opened the dor, and there \n was the giant! \n \n \n She tried to close the dor but the giant \n was to quick. He grabed Tselane and \n \n threw her into a sack. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The hapy giant walked back to his\n \n cave.“What a beautiful day! If only I had\n traditional ber, it would go so wel with\n my diner tonight,” he said to himself.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A litle later in the morning, Tselane’s \n mother came as usual to bring her \n \n daughter fod. She sang her song, but \n Tselane did not come out. She sang her \n song again, but stil Tselane did not \n \n come out. \n \n After singing for the third time, she \n \n kicked the dor open. Tselane was \n nowhere to be found. Her mother \n \n realised what had hapened, and she \n quickly made a plan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n She poured some ber into a big \n \n calabash, put it on her head, and walked\n down to the caves.“God evening, giant!”\n \n caled Tselane’s mother. \n \n The giant smeled the delicious smel of\n \n traditional ber and opened the dor.\n Tselane's mother said, “I was pasing\n \n through and I heard you singing so\n beautifuly. I am on my way to another\n vilage for a party.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n “Let me pour you some ber before I \n \n continue on my journey,” said Tselane’s \n mother. The giant was not going to let \n \n the oportunity of drinking traditional \n ber pas him by! He invited Tselane’s \n mother into his cave. \n \n \n The giant drank the ber in one great \n gulp. Tselane’s mother gave him more \n \n and more – and more – until the \n calabash was empty. \n \n \n The giant was son so drunk that he fel \n aslep on the flor. \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As son as Tselane’s mother heard the \n \n giant’s loud snores, she opened the sack \n lying in the cave. \n \n \n Tselane jumped out of the sack, and \n theyran home as fast as they could. \n \n \n From then on Tselane stayed with her \n \n mother at the new vilage. They lived \n hapily and were never again bothered \n by giants. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14 "
