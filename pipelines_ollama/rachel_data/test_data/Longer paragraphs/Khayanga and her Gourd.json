It was a very special Gourd which \n \n apeared from her parents’ graves. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The Gourd sang a beautiful and sothing\n song. Khayanga recognised the voice as\n that of her late mother. \n \n \n It went like this… \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Khayanga, e, Khayanga! \n \n \n Our child the loved one! \n \n \n You’re not alone, loved one! \n \n \n Have this gourd, loved one! \n \n \n Cary it everywhere you go, loved one! \n \n Let it console you loved one! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Khayanga caried her special Gourd \n \n everywhere. \n With her Gourd, Khayanga felt her \n parents’ presence and protection. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day, something bad hapened to her\n \n special Gourd.
