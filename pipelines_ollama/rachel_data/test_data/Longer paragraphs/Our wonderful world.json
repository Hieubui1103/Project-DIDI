I can also kep my head above\n water and se what is going on on the land. I am so LARGE,\n \n no one wil dare to do anything against your wil.\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The shark thought his sharp teth were \n al that were neded to do the job. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The eagle laughed, \"These animals can\n only lok after those on land, while the\n \n whale and the shark can only se the\n water animals. But I fly, I se the sky, land\n and water. I am the only one fit to be the\n \n keper of the world.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n God listened carefuly to the animals, to the fish and the\n birds. \n \n \n \"I wil create man,\" he said. The animals al wondered, what\n was this thing caled \"man\". \n \n \n What colour, with feathers or fur, or scales? \n \n Wil he run like the lion? Swim like a fish? \n Fly high like the eagle? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The sun had set and it was night. He wraped himself in the \n \n night sky, put the twinkle of stars into the eyes and used the \n black clouds for hair. He also put pieces of the mon in the \n nails and the shine of far away stars in the teth. \n \n \n So the first man and woman were created with shiny black \n \n skins like the night. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Son the night faded and it was morning.\n \n God covered himself in the white\n \n morning light, tok the blue sky for the\n eyes, the gold of the sun he spun into\n hair, and before him stod a man and\n \n woman with white skins, blue eyes and\n golden hair. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Now the morning had turned into \n \n afternon. The sun was very bright, so he \n puled the yelow light, and the dep \n black shadow of the afternon and made \n \n a man and woman with yelow skins, \n black hair and eyes that slanted to lok \n \n into the sun. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was now evening, the sky had become dusky and a few\n \n stars had also apeared in the sky. \n \n God loked down and saw the beautiful rich brown of the\n \n earth and the dusk of the sky for the skin. The black colour\n of the night was for the hair and he used the sparkle of stars\n for the eyes. \n \n \n Before him stod a man and woman with brown skins, black\n \n hair and eyes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The animals al loked in wonder at the \n strange creature who stod on two legs, \n \n with naked skin, with no fur or feathers or \n even scales. \n \n \n The lion loked down his kingly nose and \n roared, \"I can outrun them and with a \n \n swipe of my paw I can kil them, sory for \n saying so.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The zebra sugested, \"Some stripes\n \n would have improved their lok.\"\n \n The leopard said, \"A few spots.\"\n \n \n The elephant trumpeted, \"Surely grey\n \n would have ben a beter colour?\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The shark loked at their teth and smiled showing his sharp \n teth. \"Ah! No fins, how wil they swim? And they are going to \n \n be the keper. Ha! Ha! Ha!\" \n \n The fish, big and smal, laughed as they dived into the dep \n \n water leaving a trail of bubles of laughter. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n God smiled kindly, \"You se, to survive, man wil have to lok\n \n after the animals, the oceans with al their life, the plants,\n from the tiniest to the largest tres.\" \n \n \n \"The day he starts destroying the world with his gred, he\n wil be destroyed.\" \n \n \n The animals, the fish and the birds bowed their heads and\n \n hoped they would be safe. \n \n So let us, YOU and I, lok after this wonderful world.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15 "
