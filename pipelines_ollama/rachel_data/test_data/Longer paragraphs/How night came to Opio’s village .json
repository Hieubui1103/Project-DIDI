After a short time, his dogs started \n to chase an antelope. \n \n Opio folowed them. He ran for many \n hours. \n Every time he became tired, he rested. \n \n Then he would run again. But he could \n not find his dogs. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n After many days, he came to a vilage. He\n went to one of the houses and said to\n \n the owner, “I have chased an antelope for\n a long time and I am very tired. I want to\n rest.” \n \n The man said, “Sit down and rest. Would\n you like some ber?” \n \n Opio was very thirsty so he drank some.\n Then he went to slep. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When he woke up, he couldn’t se. He\n opened and closed his eyes many times.\n \n “You have given me something very bad\n to drink,” he said to the man. “I can’t se\n properly anymore!” \n \n “There is nothing wrong with you,” the\n man replied. “It’s night now. Haven’t you\n \n ever sen night? When the day leaves,\n the night comes.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Opio asked many questions about the \n night. He began to like it very much. \n \n He and his new friend talked until \n morning. \n He stayed for another day so that he \n \n could se the night come again. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next morning he asked his friend,\n “How can I take the night to my own\n \n vilage? I want my people to se the\n night.” \n “When it starts to get dark this evening,\n \n walk to your vilage. If you lok straight in\n front, the night wil folow you. But you\n \n must not lok back. If you lok back, the\n night wil go away.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Opio did as he was told. That evening, he \n began to walk towards his vilage. \n \n He felt the dark night behind him as he \n walked. \n He wanted to lok back. \n \n But he did not. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When he came to his vilage, the vilagers\n were afraid. \n “What disease have you brought to us,\n \n Opio?” they asked. “What is this dark\n thing folowing you?” \n Opio said, “My friends, this dark thing is\n \n caled night. Now you are afraid and I\n was afraid, to.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “But you wil learn to like the night. \n When the light comes we can work and \n \n when night comes, we can rest.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And that is how night came to Opio’s vilage. \n \n \n \n 10 "
