Nkanyezi\n \n loked forward tothe Spring festival\n more than any other dayin the year.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One warm morning, Nkanyezi overheard \n \n twovilage elders talking about the \n festival. \n \n \n “The people of Ndlovu have lost their \n spirit of celebration,” one sighed. \n \n \n “How can we have a Spring festival in a \n vilage that has forgoten how to \n \n celebrate?” askedanother. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n Nkanyezi was woried. \n \n \n “How wil the sun shine again unles we\n \n singto wake it from its winter slumber?”\n she askedherself. \n \n \n Nkanyezi thought for a long time.\n \n “I must find what we have lost,” she\n \n decided. \n \n \n “I must go in search of things that wil\n bring back the spirit of celebration to my\n vilage.” \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The elders gave Nkanyezi their blesing \n for the journey. They gave her a bag to \n \n cary the things she would find. \n \n Nkanyezi was afraid, but she believed \n \n shewould suced. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nkanyezi walked al day. She hiked up a\n hil, and down into a valey. She sailed\n \n acros the greatriver, and climbed\n betwen sharp rocks. She marched\n acros the plains until she reached\n \n theshadow of the red mountains. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n As night was closing in, Nkanyezi arived \n \n ata vilage of paterns and colours as \n she had neversen before. She told the \n vilage elders about her journey to bring \n \n back the spirit of celebration toher \n people. \n \n \n The mother of this tribe gave Nkanyezi a \n gift.She told the girl, “With love we give \n \n to you this paint to restore colour to a \n vilage that has gone dul.” \n \n \n Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the \n paint in her bag. \n \n \n Early the next morning she went on her \n way, excited with this gift of colour. \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nkanyezi walked al day, through a vast\n forest of giant tres. As the sky became\n \n to dark for her tose, she heard the\n sound of beating drums. She huried\n towards the druming, feling the\n \n spirit of dance coming to her tired fet.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nkanyezi found herself in the vilage of \n \n theBhubezi. People were siting around \n a fire,druming and singing. She had \n never beforeheard such wonderful \n \n music. \n \n She told the vilage elders about her \n \n journey tobring back the spirit of \n celebration to her people. The Bhubezi \n \n invited her to rest and stay the night. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In the morning the chief caled on\n \n Nkanyezi. \n \n \n “My child,” he said, “here is a special\n drum.It plays a new song every time you\n beat it.” \n \n \n Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the\n \n drumin her bag. She went on her way\n again, delighted with this gift of music\n and dance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n On the third day of her journey, as she a \n \n pased a field of fat cows, her nose \n started to tingle. An aroma tickled her \n \n taste buds and her mouth started to \n water. She folowed the scent, \n and arived in a vilage to find people \n \n standing oversteaming pots of stew. \n \n This tribe was famous for its feasts and \n \n Nkanyezihad never before tasted such \n flavours. After she had eaten her fil, she \n \n told the vilage elders about her journey \n to bring back the spirit of celebration to \n her people. \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n The next day, the council of coks gave\n \n her a secret spice blend. \n \n \n “Our daughter,” they said, “with these\n spices, hapy tumies are guaranted!\n We give you the gift of god fod.”\n \n \n Nkanyezi thanked the elders and put the\n spices in her bag. \n \n \n She knew she had everything she \n \n neded. With new energy she started the\n long journey back tothe vilage of\n Ndlovu. \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n When she arived home the vilagers \n gathered around her to hear of her \n adventures. She told them the tales \n \n of what she had sen, heard, and \n eaten. \n \n \n Then she opened her bag to \n share the gifts given. The vilagers \n \n rejoiced to receive these treasures. \n The generosity of others and the courage \n \n of Nkanyezi brought back colour, \n song and dance to the people. \n \n \n And so the spirit of celebration was \n restoredto the vilage of Ndlovu. \n \n \n \n \n 12 "
