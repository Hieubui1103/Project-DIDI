They \n had two children, Mukhwana and \n \n Namono. There was a famine in the land \n where they lived. Al the vilagers, \n including Mulongo and his family, would \n \n leave their homes early to lok for fod \n in the forest. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day, Mulongo, his wife and children\n decided to go dep in the forest in\n search of something to eat. From\n \n morning to evening they loked for fod\n but they found nothing. Nambuya urged\n her husband to go further into the forest.\n \n Mulongo led the way as Nambuya and\n the two children folowed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sudenly Mulongo saw a beautiful \n \n banana plantation. He caled his wife and \n said, “Is that not a banana plantation? I \n \n can se bananas and other fod crops. I \n wonder whose it is.” They moved on and \n son saw a house in the midle of the \n \n plantation. They stoped, loked in al \n directions, but there was no one around. \n \n Because they were hungry and it was \n nearly night time, they decided to sit and \n wait for the owner. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sudenly they heard heavy breathing \n close to the house. They were frightened \n to se a huge ogre arive. “Who are you \n \n and what do you want?” asked the ogre \n in a fearful voice. Mulongo in a trembling \n voice said, “We came loking for fod \n \n because there is famine in our place.” \n The ogre gave them fod. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n For several days the ogre alowed \n Mulongo and his family to eat his crops \n \n without asking for anything in return. One \n morning, however, the ogre said to \n Nambuya, “I want you to cok your son \n \n for me to eat when I come back this \n evening.” When the ogre had gone \n Mulongo went into the bush and kiled \n \n some smal animals, which he asked his \n wife to cok for the ogre. Meanwhile he \n \n asked Mukhwana to climb up a leafy \n mango tre and hide. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In the evening the ogre returned and\n asked, “Have you coked Mukhwana for\n \n me?” Mulongo’s wife answered, “Yes.”\n She gave the ogre the meat and he\n gredily ate everything. Then he said,\n \n “Tomorow you cok your daughter.”\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The folowing morning Mulongo and his \n \n wife did as they had done on the first \n day. Namono was hiden up the mango \n tre. When the ogre returned he said, \n \n “Did you cok Namono?” Again, \n Nambuya told the ogre that she had \n \n done so. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n After eating, the ogre instructed\n Nambuya to cok her husband Mulongo,\n the next day. Nambuya was perturbed\n \n but Mulongo said he would go out again\n and catch some animals to cok. He did\n that and after giving the meat to his wife,\n \n he also climbed up the mango tre to\n hide. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n At dusk the ogre came back. Nambuya \n gave the meat to the ogre who enjoyed it \n \n very much. He told Nambuya, “Tomorow \n cok yourself.” When the ogre had left \n Nambuya caled her husband to advise \n \n her. Mulongo said, “Go and lok for some \n smal animals and cok them for the \n \n ogre. When everything is ready, come up \n the tre where we are.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The ogre came back in the afternon and\n started eating his tasty evening meal of\n \n swet meat. \n He felt slepy, went to lie under the\n mango tre and began snoring. But not\n \n so long after, the ogre woke up because\n he heard noises above him. The ogre\n \n loked up to the tre and saw Mulongo\n and his wife and children. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n WThe ogre was very angry. “So you \n deceived me? Let me come and get you,” \n he shouted. \n \n As the ogre was strugling to climb up \n the tre, Mulongo quickly thought of a \n trick and said, “It wil be easier for you to \n \n reach us if you tie a rope around your \n neck and we help to pul you up.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The ogre ran into the house, brought a \n \n strong rope and after tying it around his \n neck he threw the other end of the rope \n to Mulongo. Mulongo and his wife and \n \n children started puling the ogre up as \n they twisted the rope. The rope son \n tightened around the ogre’s neck until he \n \n could not breathe and died. Mulongo and \n his family came down the tre and tok \n \n over the ogre’s house and property. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 "
