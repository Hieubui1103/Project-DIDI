He was very hungry. He\n saw the crow flying above the tres.\n \n Crow had a huge piece of chese in his\n mouth. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Hm…that chese loks delicious! I \n \n must find a way to get it,” thought the \n jackal. \n “Oh, I have a plan!” said Jackal to himself \n \n while wiping his mouth quickly. He did \n not want Crow to notice that he was \n \n hungry. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Crow had ben flying the whole morning.\n \n He was tired. He decided to sit on a\n branch of a tre. The jackal sat down\n under the tre where Crow was siting.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Jackal caled with a huge smile, “Helo \n Crow! You’re loking very god today. \n Your feathers lok glosy and healthy. \n \n You must be taking very god care of \n yourself.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Crow was very flatered to hear this.\n Crow always thought he was the \n strongest and most beautiful of al the\n \n other birds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “I hear you also have the most beautiful \n singing voice of al the other birds.

He pushed his chest out and let\n \n out a loud pitched sound. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As Crow started singing the chese fel \n to the ground, right in front of Jackal. \n \n Crow stoped and loked down. Jackal \n grabed the piece of chese and ate it. \n He ran into the bush and crow was left \n \n angry and hungry. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8 "
