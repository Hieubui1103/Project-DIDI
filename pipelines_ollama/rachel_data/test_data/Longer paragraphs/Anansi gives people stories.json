He thought his\n stories were quite safe. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So Anansi climbed slowly back down his \n \n sticky thread to the earth. He thought \n and he thought, and he came up with a \n \n plan. \n \n He dug a dep hole, covered it with \n \n branches and dirt so it was hiden, and \n he went home for super. In the morning, \n \n sure enough, a leopard had falen into his \n pit. He was furiously scratching at the \n side of the pit, but he couldn’t get out. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"Oh let me help you, my dear friend!\" said\n \n Anansi. \"Just lie down on these sticks\n and I’l pul you out.\" \n \n \n Anansi wound his sticky web round the\n leopard and the sticks, and puled him up\n to heaven to show the Sky God. \n \n But Nyame just laughed and said, \"Where\n are the other two?\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So Anansi went back down to earth to \n \n get the second creature. He thought and \n he thought and he came up with a plan. \n \n \n He tok a gourd ful of water and went to \n the tre where the hornets lived. He \n \n poured out some of the water al over \n their nest. Then he cut a leaf from a \n \n banana tre and held it over his head, \n and he poured the rest of the water al \n over himself. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He caled out to the hornets, \"Hey\n hornets! Come se! It is raining! Quick -\n \n get inside my gourd and it wil kep al of\n you dry.\" \n Hornets don’t like to get wet, so they al\n \n flew into Anansi's gourd. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Then Anansi quickly spun a web acros \n the opening so the hornets couldn't get \n \n out no mater how much they buzed. \n \n He caried them up to heaven and \n \n showed them to the Sky God. \n But Nyame just said, \"Where's the last \n \n one?\" (He wasn't laughing so much \n anymore.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So Anansi went down to earth again. He\n thought and thought and he thought, but\n \n he couldn’t come up with a plan. So he\n asked his wife, who had a very god\n \n idea. \n \n Together they found a god long thick\n \n branch and some strong vines. \n When they got near the stream where the\n \n snake lived, they began to argue.\n \"The branch is longer!\" \n \"No, it isn’t!\" \n \n \"Yes it is!\" \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Son the snake came out and asked \n what the argument was. \n \n \"I was arguing with my wife,\" said Anansi. \n \"She says this stick is longer than you \n are. But I don’t agre.\" \n \n \"Of course I’m longer than that stick!\" \n said the snake. \n \n \"I'm very long! I'm a huge snake! Just put \n your stick next to me and measure!\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So Anansi did that, and he tied the snake\n to the stick with his vine to kep him\n \n straight. \n \n When he was al tied up, Anansi tok the\n \n snake up to heaven. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nyame had to admit that Anansi had \n paid his price. So he went to his woden \n \n box, opened the lid, and gave al the \n stories to Anansi. \n \n \n Anansi caried the stories triumphantly \n down to earth. \n He shared them with his wife, and with \n \n al the other animals and people. \n \n \n Stories are for teling, not for keping in \n woden boxes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 "
