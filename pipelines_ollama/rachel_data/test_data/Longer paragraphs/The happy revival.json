From the two dimples on its side came springs\n \n which converged downhil to form a river. River Temu\n meandered silently acros the Kwere plains. Its waters were\n a gift to the shep and goats of the area as wel as the der\n \n that dwelt in the plains. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Things were al wel until Matata became headman. \n He ordered a path to be cleared from the top of the hil to the \n fot so that he could climb uphil easily and rol gently down \n \n to the fot. Olokwango hil was angry with the damage to his \n beard, but he was patient. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n During the wekend, Matata’s children and their friends\n would climb uphil to play. \n They would run al over the place, breaking twigs and\n \n branches, lighting fires for their games, which they would\n later leave burning. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Over time, Olokwango lost patience. The dimples became \n smaler and smaler as his face turned into ugly wrinkles. \n \n \n At last the springs were no more. The der in the plains \n migrated because there was no more the tal gren gras to \n play in. The shep and goats grew thiner and thiner. \n \n \n Everyone felt the sadnes of Olokwango hil. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The people of Kwere realized that something neded to be\n done. \n They joined hands and overthrew Matata the headman.\n \n \n In his place they apointed Baraka who imediately ordered\n everyone to plant a flower to honour Olokwango. Baraka and\n \n his people held ceremonies and brought gifts of pine, cedar,\n and cypres for Olokwango. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n No one walked on the hil any longer, and the gras had a\n chance to grow tal once again. \n \n \n Gradualy the smile on the face of Olokwango hil grew\n broader and the dimples deper. Out of the dimples the\n springs ran again. River Temu was rejuvenated. The plains\n \n became grener than ever before. The der galoped hapily\n once more acros the gras. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Long live Baraka, long live Baraka,” the people of Kwere \n \n sang. \n “Long live, Olokwango,” said Baraka and his people. “May our \n children and children’s children forever respect you.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7 "
