The fod was \n \n not ready and the goats were stil in the \n kral! \n \n \n “Young man, you are so lazy! Go and find \n a wife. I am to old to lok after you,” \n \n said Jackal’s father. So Jackal jumped up \n and tok the goats out to graze. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In the bush, he saw something shining\n on a rock. He went closer and closer to\n the rock. The closer he got, the more\n \n beautiful the shine was. Perhaps this\n was the wife for him?! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “You are beautiful,” said Jackal to the \n \n shine. “But who are you? Why are you \n alone?” \n “I am the sun,” the shine answered. “My \n \n family left me here when they moved on. \n They did not want to cary me. I am to \n \n hot.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The jackal said, “But you are so beautiful!\n I wil cary you. I wil take you home to\n \n met my father.” \n “Al right, you can cary me. But do not\n complain when I get to hot for you,” said\n \n the sun. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So Jackal put the sun on his back and \n started the journey home. Before long, \n \n the sun was burning Jackal’s fur. \n “Wil you please come down from my \n back? I ned to rest,” said Jackal. His \n \n back was so sore that he could hardly \n walk. \n \n “Just cary on!” said the sun. “I told you \n not to complain!” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Then Jackal saw a log acros the path.\n He crawled under the log so that the sun\n \n would fal of. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But the log also scraped the skin and fur \n from his back and they were left behind \n \n with the sun. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The new fur was a diferent colour to the\n fur on the rest of his body. \n \n \n The diferent colours always reminded\n Jackal not to be so folish again.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n Story notes \n In 205, Naro storyteler Bega Cgase from the Kalahari Desert in Botswana\n \n told this story to Marlene Winberg, who retels it here. The story apears in\n diferent versions in many southern African San comunities. It warns\n \n folish young men not to be confused by the outside apearance of a girl,\n and tels parents not to force their children to mary for the sake of\n domestic help. It also provokes the powerful presence of the hot sun in the\n \n desert and does what stories do – give everything in nature a personality.\n \n \n The ilustrations in this story are from story boards by Marlene Winberg,\n interpreted digitaly by Satsiri Winberg through manipulations of the\n Manyeka Art Colection of paintings made by San artists /Thalu Rumao,\n \n /Tuoi Samcuia and Joao Wene Dikuango, who have al pased away since.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 "
