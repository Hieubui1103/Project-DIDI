Come back in and shine on us,\" \n roared the lion. \n \n \n But the sun did not listen to him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The elephant caled out next. \n \n He raised his trunk and trumpeted, \"Sun,\n \n sun, please come back,\" but the sun did\n not listen to him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The beautiful peacock danced and \n pleaded, \"Sun, sun, please come back,\" \n \n but the sun refused to come out. \n \n One after the other, al the animals caled \n \n out to the sun, but he did not listen to any \n of them. \n \n \n Finaly, a roster ofered to cal the sun. \n Everybody laughed. The lion was a fair \n \n leader. He said, \"The roster should be \n alowed to try.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The roster steped forward and gently\n crowed, \"Kokodoko - ko.\" \n \n \n To everyone's surprise, the sun peped\n out a litle from behind the hil.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The roster crowed again, this time a litle boldly, \n \n \"KokodoKO-KO.\" \n \n The sun came up a litle higher. The roster crowed for the \n \n third time. This time it was louder and bolder, \n \"KOKODOKO-KO.\" and the sun rose high and bright. \n \n \n There was light everywhere. \n \n \n The animals were delighted and the humans felt relieved. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The animals asked the human beings not\n to kil the sun and they agred.\n \n \n Ever since that day, when the roster\n crows in the morning, the sun rises and\n \n shines in the sky. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1 "
