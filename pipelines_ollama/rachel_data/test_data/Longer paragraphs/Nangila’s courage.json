He could\n not stand or walk. This man lived in a\n vilage with his wife and their children.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The couple had thre sons and one \n daughter. The daughter’s name was \n Nangila. Her duty was to take care of her \n \n father. The sons worked on the land and \n grazed animals. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nangila was a beautiful girl. Al the\n vilagers liked and respected her. Her\n parents wanted a god husband for\n \n Nangila. They set a dificult task in order\n to find the right man. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Anyone who wanted to mary Nangila \n would have to get a herb from a lake near \n the vilage. This herb would heal her \n \n father’s wound. But the lake was filed \n with dangerous spirits. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Some men tried to get the herb and\n \n returned without it. \n Some men did not return from the lake at\n al. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nangila felt woried. Not even her \n \n brothers would go to the lake. She \n decided to fetch the herb herself. \n \n \n Her mother said, “My daughter, if strong \n men have failed, wil you suced?” But \n \n Nangila had made up her mind. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n On the way to the lake, Nangila met an\n old woman carying wod. She helped\n the woman to cary her firewod.\n \n \n The old woman was grateful. She said to\n Nangila, “I wil tel you how to reach the\n \n spirit lake and what to do when you get\n there.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When she reached the shore of the lake, \n \n Nangila saw the spirit family drinking and \n dancing. She waited and watched. One \n by one, the spirits fel aslep. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Once the spirits were al sleping Nangila\n \n dived into the lake. She found the herb\n and put it in her bag. As she swam back\n to land, the waves were high around her.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n When Nangila reached the shore the \n spirits were awake. She was afraid, but \n she sang the song the old woman taught \n \n her: \n \n \n I, daughter of Wekesa, \n Am from the lake. \n I came because men are to scared to \n \n come. \n My father neds this herb to heal his \n \n wound. \n That is why am here, \n In the land where many are scared to \n \n reach, \n For you are the rulers. \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nangila’s voice was so swet that the\n spirits asked her to sing for them again\n and again. Her singing sent the spirits\n \n back to slep. Then Nangila ran very fast\n until she got to her vilage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Everyone was waiting for Nangila to \n return. After treating his wound with the \n herb her father was able to stand again. \n \n The entire vilage danced and praised \n Nangila. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 "
