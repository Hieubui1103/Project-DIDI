He walked until\n he got to an indigenous forest. \n \n \n He started to get scared but was\n comforted by the thought that nobody\n \n would speak to him because nobody\n loved him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When he was about to enter the forest, \n an old, dirty, ugly woman came up to him. \n \n She greted him and asked what he was \n doing in the scary forest. \n \n \n The boy was shocked to hear someone \n speaking to him. He told the old woman \n \n that he wasn't going anywhere because \n no one loved him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The old woman asked if he neded help.\n He responded quickly and said “Yes”.\n The old woman said that before she\n \n helped him, she wanted him to lick her\n face until she was clean and beautiful.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The boy didn’t have any other option but \n \n to lick the old woman’s face in order to \n get the help he neded. He started \n licking the slep from her eyes, the snot \n \n from her nose and the wax from her ears. \n He licked her face until she was clean \n \n and beautiful. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The old woman thanked him. She said,\n “You wil find many wonderful things in\n the forest, but don’t take any of these\n \n things. Only bring back the rot that you\n find.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The boy ran, wanting to se al of those\n things in the forest. But before he could\n \n enter the forest, the old woman caled\n him. She said, “Boy! Come back here!”\n \n \n He ran back to her and said, “I’m here”.\n She asked him if he had heard what she\n \n said to him. “I said you wil find many\n wonderful things in the forest, but don’t\n \n take any of these things. Only bring back\n the rot that you find,” she repeated. The\n boy noded and so the old woman \n \n alowed him to go into the forest.\n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The boy ran of, but before he could enter \n the forest, he heard a voice saying, “Boy! \n \n Come back here!” He started to be \n confused about what the old woman \n wanted. He ran back to her. \n \n \n She said, “I don’t think you heard me \n properly. I said you wil find many \n \n wonderful things in the forest, but don’t \n take any of these things. Only bring back \n \n the rot that you find.” The boy noded \n and ran back to the forest. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n Just after he had entered the forest, he \n \n heard a voice again saying, “Boy! Come \n back here!” He tried to ignore the voice \n \n but it continued so he went back to the \n old woman. \n \n \n The old woman said, “I don’t trust you. I \n don’t think you’l do what I ask you to do. \n You wil find many wonderful things in \n \n the forest, but don’t take anything. Only \n bring back the rot that you find.” The \n \n boy was becoming anoyed with the \n repetition. He ran until he was in the \n forest. \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Once he was in the forest, he saw a bowl\n filed with money. He tok the money and\n \n put it in his pocket. Al of a suden, he\n thought about what the old woman said,\n that he mustn’t take anything except the\n \n rot. \n \n \n He tok the money out his pocket and\n put it back in the bowl. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He loked around and saw some \n \n splendid new clothes. He tok of the \n clothes he was wearing and put on the \n new ones. Again he thought about what \n \n the old woman had said. He tok of the \n new clothes and put his old ones back \n \n on. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He loked around and saw the rot. It \n was withered from the sun. He asked \n himself what the old woman thought he \n \n would do with the rot. Next to the rot, \n there was a bowl of fod. The fod \n smeled delicious and the boy was \n \n hungry. He couldn’t stop himself from \n eating. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When he had finished, he remembered\n \n what the old woman had told him. He\n remembered that the old woman had\n said he must only take the rot.\n \n \n He loked around for the rot, but he\n \n couldn’t se it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He went back, feling disapointed, to\n tel the old woman what had hapened.\n \n But the old woman was gone. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 "
