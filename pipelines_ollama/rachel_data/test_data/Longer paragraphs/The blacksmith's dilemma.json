But no\n one could say no to the king in this\n \n vilage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ratshipi could not slep that night. \n \n How was he going to do this imposible \n task? \n He was very scared and very woried. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sudenly Ratshipi remembered a wise\n \n old man Rapule. Perhaps he could help.\n \n But where was Rapule? He had \n \n disapeared from the vilage. People said\n that it was because he had displeased\n \n the chief. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next morning Ratshipi did not go to \n his shop. \n \n He went up the mountains to think. \n \n While walking there, he saw an old man \n \n siting under a tre. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was old Rapule! \n \n “I am so pleased to se you,” said \n Ratshipi. \n “I have a big problem.” \n \n He told Old Rapule the whole story. \n Old Rapule thought carefuly, and then he \n \n said… \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Tel the chief that you wil ned a\n thousand buckets ful of tears and a\n thousand African pots ful of hair. With\n \n the water, you wil make blod. With the\n hair, you wil make a fire to strengthen\n the stel man.” \n \n “Thank you, thank you!” Ratshipi said,\n runing back to the palace. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Ratshipi said, “Kgosi Mogale, to do what \n \n you ask, I wil ned two things. A \n thousand buckets ful of tears; and a \n thousand African pots filed with hair \n \n from the heads of the vilagers.” \n Kgosi Mogale agred. He asked his \n \n headmen to tel the vilagers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Cries were heard from every corner of\n \n the vilage. Young and old people cried\n day and night to fil a thousand buckets\n with tears. \n \n Every vilager’s head was shaved of and\n thrown into the pots. \n \n \n But the tears and hair of al the vilagers\n were not enough to fil the buckets and\n \n pots. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Eventualy Kgosi Mogale gave up and \n \n caled Ratshipi back to the palace. \n “Ratshipi, you are a wise man, the wisest \n in the vilage,” said Kgosi Mogale. “Wil \n \n you do me the honour of being my chief \n headman?” \n \n Ratshipi smiled. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Only if you let old Rapule come back to\n the vilage,” he replied. \n \n \n So Ratshipi became chief headman.\n And he and old Rapule were the advisors\n \n of Kgosi Mogale. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15 "
