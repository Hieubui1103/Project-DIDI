Tasnem loved to wear that \n apron. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The other girls in that place were jealous\n of Tasnem’s makgabe. They thought\n \n that it would be beter to get rid of it.\n But it is a dificult thing to take a person’s\n clothes when that person is wearing\n \n them. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One morning the girls invited Tasnem to \n \n go swiming with them in a river nearby. \n At the river bank, they al tok of their \n makgabes so that the cloth would not be \n \n damaged. \n Then they jumped into the water and \n \n splashed around for some time. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n They finished swiming. The leader of\n the jealous girls threw Tasnem’s\n makgabe into the river, near the place of\n \n a very large snake. Then al the other\n girls left Tasnem crying by the river.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The large snake heard someone \n \n weping. He slithered out and saw the \n beautiful Tasnem. He swalowed the \n makgabe and Tasnem whole. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Fortunately for her, the snake did not like\n the taste of the makgabe. He spat it and\n Tasnem out. They lay on the river bank,\n \n covered with slime from the snake’s\n stomach. This slime smeled very bad.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The smely Tasnem in her smely \n makgabe ran home to her parents. \n \n She sang … \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mother, open the dor for me, I am smeling; \n \n Mother, open the dor for me, I am smeling, \n I am smeling very bad. \n \n \n The mother heard Tasnem’s song and ran out of the house. \n \n \n She sang back to the girl: \n \n \n Go away, you are smeling, \n Go away, you are smeling, \n Go away, you are smeling very bad. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tasnem was very upset. \n \n She ran of to the house of her aunt and \n uncle. \n They heard her singing … \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Open the dor for me, I am smeling; \n Open the dor for me, I am smeling, \n \n I am smeling very bad. \n \n They ran out of their house. They sang back: \n \n \n Go away, you are smeling, \n \n Go away, you are smeling, \n Go away, you are smeling very bad. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tasnem had only her grandmother’s\n \n house to go to. Her heart was heavy. She\n thought nobody wanted to lok after a\n bad smeling girl. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But she was wrong. Her grandmother did \n \n not send her away. \n She washed Tasnem, and her makgabe, \n making everything smel swetly. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tasnem stayed with her grandmother\n \n for many years. \n One day the son of a very rich chief\n asked Tasnem to mary him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tasnem’s parents heard about the \n mariage and asked her to come back to \n \n live in their house. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tasnem remembered how she had \n \n smeled so bad. \n She told them that she would never go\n back to their house. \n \n \"Parents must love their children,\" she\n said, \"even if their children smel very\n \n bad.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Instead Tasnem invited her \n grandmother to come and live with her in \n \n the house of this rich chief and his son. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17  \n \n \n \n \n The grandmother was very hapy, and very comfortable, and very important. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 18 "
