Like a shoe in the \n \n midle of his face. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A curious baby elephant \n \n was born. She had a \n \n question for every animal. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n She was curious about \n \n Girafe. \n \n “Why do you have a long \n \n neck?” she asked. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n She was curious about \n \n Rhino. \n \n “Why does your horn have \n \n a sharp point?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n She was curious about \n \n Hipo. \n \n “Why do you have red \n \n eyes?” she asked. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And she was VERY curious \n \n about Crocodile. \n \n “What does Crocodile eat \n \n for diner?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Never ask a question like \n \n that!” said her mother. \n \n She walked of, frowning. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But clever Crow quickly \n \n said, “Folow me to the \n \n river. There you wil se \n \n what Crocodile eats for \n \n diner.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So Baby Elephant folowed \n \n Crow al the way down to \n \n the river. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n She pushed through the \n \n reds and stod on the \n \n bank. \n \n She loked into the water. \n \n Where was Crocodile? \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Helo,” said a stone near \n \n the river bank. \n \n “Helo,” said Baby \n \n Elephant. \n \n “Perhaps you can tel me \n \n what Crocodile eats for \n \n diner?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Bend down and I wil tel \n \n you,” said the stone. \n \n “Lower, lower.” \n \n \n \n So Baby Elephant bent \n \n down lower, until… \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Snap!” Her nose was in \n \n the jaws of Crocodile. \n \n \n \n “Crocodile wil eat you for \n \n diner!” squawked Crow. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Baby Elephant sat back on \n \n her strong legs and puled, \n \n and puled, and puled. \n \n \n \n But Crocodile did not let \n \n go. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Baby Elephant’s nose \n \n stretched, and stretched, \n \n and stretched, until… \n \n \n \n “Duf!” she fel on her \n \n back. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Cros at losing his diner, \n \n Crocodile slithered back \n \n into the water. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Baby Elephant loked at \n \n her nose. \n \n She could not se where it \n \n ended! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 18  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was so long she could \n \n pick fruit from high \n \n branches. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 19  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And shower herself with \n \n water on a hot day. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 20  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And to this day, al \n \n elephants have very long \n \n and useful trunks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 21 "
