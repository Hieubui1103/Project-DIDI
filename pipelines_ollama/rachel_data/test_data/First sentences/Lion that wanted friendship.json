The lion \n \n realised that the man was \n \n a meat lover. It began to \n \n fear that the man would kil \n \n it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The lion feared that \n \n perhaps the man might \n \n spear it with his spears. \n \n The man feared that the \n \n lion might eat him at night \n \n when he slept. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One night the man \n \n dreamed that the lion was \n \n moving towards him \n \n slowly, trying to eat him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The man tok up his spear, \n \n shouting, “If you want to \n \n eat me, then I wil spear \n \n you.” The lion woke up and \n \n ran out, “I said this man wil \n \n one day kil me.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n From that day, the lion and \n \n the man were no longer \n \n friends. The lion wil kil a \n \n human whenever it finds \n \n one. And humans wil kil a \n \n lion if they can. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n That is why it is said: if someone wants friendship \n \n with you, you should first know about that person’s \n \n character. You should know if you can be together \n \n peacefuly. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8 "
