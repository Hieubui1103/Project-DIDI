He practised and \n \n practised. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The other animals told \n \n Hyena to swalow a fly \n \n from the river so that he \n \n could sing beter. \n \n \n \n He swalowed a fly from \n \n the river and he came to \n \n sing. But the dor did not \n \n \n open. \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He swalowed a fly from \n \n the plains and he came to \n \n sing. But the dor did not \n \n open. \n \n \n \n Finaly he swalowed a fly \n \n from the far away plains. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He came to sing, and the \n \n dor opened. \n \n \n \n Hyena ate Atabo. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When mother came again, \n \n she sang, and sang, and \n \n sang. But nothing \n \n hapened. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mother caled a meting of \n \n al the animals and lit a \n \n very big fire. \n \n \n \n “The animal that ate Atabo \n \n wil fal into the fire and \n \n burn,” she said. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Al the animals jumped \n \n safely over the fire until the \n \n fox had a turn. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Fox jumped and the fire \n \n caught his tail. \n \n \n \n He cried in pain. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 18  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Last of al came the hyena. \n \n \n \n He jumped and fel in the \n \n fire. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 19  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Then the animals sang \n \n another song: \n \n \n \n “Ata kalio, \n \n Anikanyamit ikon koku, \n \n Achakakin nakim na, \n \n Chi.gi.gir.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 20 "
