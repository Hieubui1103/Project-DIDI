In \n \n the midle of the river there \n \n was a smal island. Lots of \n \n fruit tres grew on that \n \n island. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The monkey wanted to go \n \n and eat the fruit. He saw a \n \n big rock half way acros \n \n the river and he thought he \n \n could jump onto the rock, \n \n and then onto the island. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He jumped into the air and \n \n landed on the rock. He \n \n jumped again and reached \n \n the island. He enjoyed \n \n eating the fruit and then \n \n went back home. He did \n \n this several times. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But a crocodile lived in the \n \n river with his wife! The wife \n \n said, \"Dear husband, you \n \n should go and lie on the \n \n rock. The colour of your \n \n skin matches the colour of \n \n the rock.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A few days later, the \n \n crocodile saw the monkey \n \n coming onto the island. He \n \n quietly climbed over the \n \n rock and carefuly lay down \n \n on it and kept his face \n \n underwater. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The monkey finished eating \n \n and was ready to go back. \n \n But the rock loked higher \n \n than usual, so he spoke to \n \n the rock, \"Dear rock, you \n \n sem to have grown. Are \n \n you al right?\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The crocodile was a fol \n \n and thought the rock must \n \n be a talking rock. So he \n \n answered the monkey and \n \n said, \"I lok biger because \n \n a big crocodile is lying on \n \n me\". \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The monkey said, \"Dear \n \n crocodile, I know you want \n \n to eat me. I am very old \n \n and you can have my body. \n \n But I must say godbye to \n \n my children in that big \n \n tre.\" So the crocodile gave \n \n him a ride on his back! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As son as they were there, \n \n the monkey climbed the \n \n tre and said, “Thank you \n \n for the ride, my dear friend. \n \n Godbye, now you can go \n \n home!\" But the crocodile \n \n said, \"But you promised….\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The monkey laughed and \n \n said, \"What a fol you were \n \n to believe me!\" and \n \n disapeared behind the \n \n branches of the tre. The \n \n crocodile never did catch \n \n that clever monkey! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10 "
