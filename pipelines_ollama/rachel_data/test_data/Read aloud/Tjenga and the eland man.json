They understod each other,\n played together, hunted together and\n \n shared their fod. Tjenga left his family\n and went to stay with Ngu’s family.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Early one morning Tjenga left to hunt in \n the bush. After searching for some time, \n \n the young hunter found the fotprint of \n an antelope on the ground. It belonged to \n an eland, the most beautiful of al \n \n antelopes. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Quietly, he folowed the eland’s fotprints. Careful not to step on any dry,\n noisy gras, he walked, crawled and crept al day long until he finaly found\n the eland. It was grazing on a hil. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Quietly, Tjenga set his arow in the bow\n and puled until the string was tight and\n \n ready. He aimed at the eland’s heart.\n Tjenga released the poison arow and it\n flew through the air. The arow hit the\n \n eland’s heart. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tjenga was afraid because he had shot \n \n the beautiful eland. He lay down silently \n in the bush, resting and waiting for the \n poison arow to do its work. The sky and \n \n the air around Tjenga shivered from the \n miday heat while the hunter waited for \n \n the eland to die. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n Sudenly, the eland turned into a person. Tjenga’s heart was even more\n \n afraid, for he did not mean to kil a person. What would the people say if they\n found that he had kiled a person? \n \n \n Tjenga walked to his friend Ngu, to tel him what had hapened. \n When he found his friend and told him the news, he said, “I am in big trouble.\n \n I hunted an eland and after I shot it, it became a person. Please, you must\n help me now so that I can bury it before the people se what I have done.”\n Ngu said, “Oh no! You are not my own family. I canot make your problem\n \n my problem!” \n \n \n With a sore heart, the young hunter returned to his own people. Tjenga told\n them his story. Without saying much, his father said, “Come, let us go and\n have a lok.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When the family got to the hunting\n ground where Tjenga had shot the eland,\n \n they did not find a dead person there.\n The father said, “Did you lie to me?”\n “No,” said the boy, “I told you about my\n \n hunt and the eland man just as I saw it.”\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n His mother said, “You did not kil a person. This is meat, it is an animal and\n \n we must eat it because we are hungry. We ned its skin to make clothes.\n That is why you shot the eland. From now on you must understand that\n people are people and animals are animals.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Tjenga’s family made more fire. They\n danced al night and celebrated the fod\n \n that the hunter had brought home.\n Tjenga’s father said to him, “Now you\n have learnt a great leson. You canot\n \n leave your own people and adopt \n another. When you are in serious trouble,\n \n it is your own people who wil help you\n and not your friends.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n Story notes \n In 198 !Xun storyteler Manuel Maseka (1954–206) told this traditional\n oral story to Kapilolo Mahongo, who retold it in Afrikans to Marlene\n \n Winberg, who retold it in English. Manuel Maseka explained that it was a\n tale about a young hunter, Tjenga’s remorse at kiling the eland. Tjenga’s\n \n elders explain to the young hunter that the beautiful antelope is not a human\n being, that animals and people are diferent. As with many San stories, this\n one hints at the primeval time before humans and animals were separated\n \n from each other. It also teaches about the diference betwen family and\n friends. \n \n \n The ilustrations in this story are from story boards by Marlene Winberg,\n interpreted digitaly by Satsiri Winberg through manipulations of the\n \n Manyeka Art Colection of paintings made by San artists /Thalu Rumao,\n /Tuoi Samcuia and Joao Wene Dikuango, who have al pased away since.\n \n \n \n \n \n 10 "
