He stoped and\n listened carefuly, searching until he saw the bird in the branches above his\n head. \n \n \n \"Chitik-chitik-chitik,\" the litle bird ratled, as he flew to the next tre, and the\n \n next. \n \n \"Chitik, chitik, chitik,\" he caled, stoping from time to time to be sure that\n \n Garte folowed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n After half an hour, they reached a huge \n wild fig tre. \n \n Togar hoped about madly among the \n branches. He then setled on one branch \n and cocked his head at Garte as if to \n \n say, \"Here it is! Come now! What is taking \n you so long?\" \n \n Garte couldn't se any bes from under \n the tre, but he trusted Togar. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So Garte put down his hunting spear\n under the tre, gathered some dry twigs\n \n and made a smal fire. \n When the fire was burning wel, he put a\n long dry stick into the heart of the fire.\n \n This wod was especialy known to\n make lots of smoke while it burned.\n \n He began climbing, holding the col end\n of the smoking stick in his teth.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Son he could hear the loud buzing of \n the busy bes. They were coming in and \n \n out of a holow in the tre trunk – their \n hive. \n When Garte reached the hive he pushed \n \n the smoking end of the stick into the \n holow. \n The bes came rushing out, angry and \n \n mean. They flew away because they \n didn’t like the smoke – but not before \n \n they had given Garte some painful \n stings! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When the bes were out, Garte pushed\n his hands into the nest. He tok out\n handfuls of the heavy comb, driping\n \n with rich honey and ful of fat, white\n grubs. \n He put the comb carefuly in the pouch\n \n he caried on his shoulder, and started to\n climb down the tre. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Togar eagerly watched everything that \n Garte was doing. He was waiting for \n \n him to leave a fat piece of honeycomb as \n a thank-you ofering to the Honeyguide. \n Togar flitered from branch to branch, \n \n closer and closer to the ground. Finaly \n Garte reached the botom of the tre. \n \n Togar perched on a rock near the boy \n and waited for his reward. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But, Garte put out the fire, picked up his spear and started walking home,\n ignoring the bird. \n Togar caled out angrily, \"VIC-tor! VIC-tor!\" \n \n Garte stoped, stared at the litle bird and laughed aloud. \"You want some\n honey, do you, my friend? Ha! But I did al the work, and got al the stings.\n Why should I share any of this lovely honey with you?\" Then he walked of.\n \n Togar was furious! This was no way to treat him! But he would get his\n revenge. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day several weks later Garte again heard the honey cal of the\n Honeyguide, Togar. He remembered the delicious honey, and eagerly \n \n folowed the bird once again. \n \n After leading Garte along the edge of the forest, Togar stoped to rest in a\n \n great umbrela thorn. \"Ah,\" thought Garte. \n \n \n \"The hive must be in this tre.\" He quickly made his smal fire and began to\n climb, the smoking branch in his teth. Togar sat and watched. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Garte climbed, wondering why he didn't hear the usual buzing. \"Perhaps\n the hive is dep in the tre,\" he thought to himself. \n \n \n He puled himself up another branch. But instead of the hive, he was staring\n into the face of a leopard! \n Leopard was very angry at having her slep so rudely interupted. She\n \n narowed her eyes, opened her mouth to reveal her very large and very sharp\n teth. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Before Leopard could take a swipe at Garte, he rushed down the tre.\n In his hury he mised a branch, and landed with a heavy thud on the ground\n \n twisting his ankle. He hobled of as fast as he could. \n Luckily for him, Leopard was stil to slepy to chase him. \n Togar, the Honeyguide, had his revenge. \n \n And Garte learned his leson. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And so, when the children of Garte hear \n the story of Togar they have respect for \n \n the litle bird. \n Whenever they harvest honey, they make \n sure to leave the bigest part of the \n \n comb for Honeyguide! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15 "
