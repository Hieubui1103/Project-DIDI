Katitu\n \n Momambo was the youngest of the \n thre. She was smal but clever and wise.\n \n \n The big girls went into the veld one day\n to gather fod and wod. Litle Katitu ran\n after them, but the sisters sent her back.\n \n “Go back Katitu! You are to smal to go\n with us! Stay at home!” they said.\n \n \n Katitu folowed them from a distance.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n When they noticed her, they were to far \n \n away from home to send her back, so \n she joined them. \n \n \n While she was walking behind them, \n Katitu cut herself some wod. She made \n \n herself a bow and many arows. \n \n The girls walked and walked and walked \n \n until the sun droped into the Kalahari \n horizon. They were lost. \n \n \n They walked into a deserted vilage and \n found a hut in which to spend the night. \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n An old woman was siting next to the\n \n hut. \n \n Litle Katitu went and greted her.\n \n “Oh?” answered the old woman, “This is\n the vilage of the Big Snake! He stays in a\n big hole in the catle kral. When people\n \n come to milk the cows, he eats them! He\n wil go to your hut at night when you\n \n slep and kil you there!” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Wise litle Katitu did not panic. She asked the old woman for a hard cow skin\n \n to cover the dor of their sleping hut. Then Katitu wanted to slep a litle,\n so that she could stay awake throughout the night. “When the wind begins\n to blow,” she said to her sisters, “you must wake me up.” \n \n \n The wind came up, the sisters awoke Katitu and went to slep. Katitu fixed\n the hard cow skin against the dor of the hut and made a litle hole in the\n \n midle for her bow and arows. \n \n \n Katitu heard the Big Snake aproach. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Hai, gom-gom, hai, gom-gom, where are\n \n they?” sang the Big Snake. \n The litle clever girl answered him with a\n chant, “Here they are, here they are!”\n \n Then the Big Snake rushed against the\n hard skin at the dor of the hut. Litle\n Katitu shot an arow through the hole in\n \n the skin. \n \n \n Yes, the litle girl kiled the Big Snake.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Then Katitu woke up the older girls. \n “Sister, sister, sister,” she whispered, “get \n \n up, get up, get up!” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n And when the girls woke up they saw a\n big snake lying there. \n \n “Come, we have to take him back to his\n hole!” shouted Katitu. \n They roled him up, roled him up, roled\n \n him up and they set him right back in his\n hole. \n \n “Hury! We have to run!” And the girls ran\n and ran and ran. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next morning, the Big Snake’s wife told his children to go and lok for\n \n him. When his children found him lying dead in his hole, they screamed:\n “Father is dead! Quick, let us go after those girls!” \n \n \n Al the snake’s children went after the girls. \n \n Katitu told her sisters to turn into tres. When the snakes arived at the spot\n \n where they had sen the girls, only tres were standing there. The snakes\n were tired and lay under the tres to slep. When they were aslep, the girls\n \n turned back into human beings and ran on. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The girls continued to run and were very\n tired and thirsty. Eventualy, they saw a\n \n waterhole! None of older sisters wanted\n to scop the water from the dep wel.\n They asked Katitu to climb in as she was\n \n the smalest. \n \n “Wil you help me out of the wel if I climb\n \n into it?” asked Katitu. \n “Yes,” they replied, “we wil help you.”\n \n Katitu went into the wel and scoped\n water for her sisters. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Each girl drank and then walked away. \n They al left Katitu in the dep wel and \n \n walked home. \n \n Later that evening, the elephants came to \n \n drink. One of them drank and left. \n Another one drank and left. The last \n elephant drank and swalowed Katitu \n \n with the water! \n \n \n A few drops of Katitu’s blod sprayed \n onto the reds growing at the water hole. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n Meanwhile, Katitu’s sisters had arived home without any fod or wod.\n \n They were crying and told the family that Katitu was lost. Everyone started\n searching for her. \n \n \n Katitu’s litle brother and his friend were searching to. They became very\n tired and rested next to a waterhole. They cut some reds to make \n \n themselves flutes. When Katitu’s brother played on his flute, the flute sang\n by itself: \n \n \n “Is this my brother who plays me, who plays me, \n The other girls left me, left me and the elephant swalowed me, swalowed\n \n me!” \n The boy rushed home and handed the red to his father, who played it. And\n again, the red sang: \n \n “Is this my father who plays me, plays me? \n The other girls left me, left me, and the elephant swalowed me, swalowed\n me!” \n \n The father handed the red to Katitu’s mother, who played it. And again, the\n red sang: \n \n “Is this my mother who plays me, plays me? \n The other girls left me, left me, and the elephant swalowed me, swalowed\n 1 \n me!”  \n \n \n \n \n \n Katitu’s father caled the young men of \n \n the homestead and ordered them to find \n the tracks of the elephants and find \n \n Katitu. \n \n The young men huried of. They met the \n \n first group of elephants and asked them, \n “Elephants, elephants, have you sen the \n one who swalowed our girl?” \n \n And the elephants sang: \n “!a plaf! !a plaf! We trot lightly. We are so \n \n light, we cary nothing!” \n \n And they pased on. \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The young men met up with an old\n \n elephant in the bush and asked, “Old\n elephant, elephant, have you sen the\n one who swalowed our girl?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The old elephant sang: \n “!a plaf! !a plaf! I trot lightly! I am so light, \n \n I cary nothing!” \n \n But now the young men heard a litle \n \n voice in the bely of the elephant. \n “Cut him open! Go on, cut him on his left \n \n side, for I am siting on his left side!” said \n the voice. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n They held the old elephant down and cut open his bely. There was litle\n Katitu lying inside! The young men tok her out and caried her home. Katitu\n \n was welcomed as a hero by the vilagers. \n \n And that is the tale of Katitu Mamombo. The wise litle girl who saved her\n \n sisters from the Big Snake, saved them from the snake’s children, and (with\n the help of her brother) saved herself from the bely of the elephant.\n \n \n Of course, her sisters were punished. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n Story notes \n \n Ju|’hoan storyteler, Nxisae Magdaline Nxao, told a short version of this\n story in Dkar, Botswana, in 205 (Winberg 209). In 193, Sigrid Schmidt\n \n recorded another version from Paulina Oxoros in northern Namibia (Schmidt\n 207: 59). This particular version was retold by Marlene Winberg in 2013 for\n the Cave to Cave European Union storyteling project in Spain, based on\n \n Nxao and Schmidt’s recording. The ‘clever litle girl’ belongs to a wel-known\n story type where a vulnerable young girl (or young boy), saves the lives of\n others, by engaging her wit and the power of words, rather than supernatural\n \n means to solve problems. \n \n \n The ilustrations in this story are from story boards by Marlene Winberg,\n interpreted digitaly by Satsiri Winberg through manipulations of the\n Manyeka Art Colection of paintings made by San artists. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 "
