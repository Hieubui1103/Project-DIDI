In the\n \n heart of this forest, in the highest\n branches of an enormous tre, lived a\n very special bird − the bird that made\n \n rain. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n For as far back as the vilagers could \n remember, they had taken the time to \n \n kep this bird hapy. They saved scraps \n of bread, pieces of fruit and fresh \n coconut milk, and every wek or two a \n \n group of vilagers tok these delicacies \n into the forest. When they had laid them \n \n at the base of the tre, one of them \n played a simple tune on the thumb piano. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n After a while, the bird flew down to the\n ground to eat and drink. When she had\n finished, she began to sing the most\n \n beautiful song. \n \n At the same time, she raised her dark,\n \n shiny blue wings, and within minutes, the\n rain began to fal. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This went on for many years. Because \n \n the rain fel regularly, the crops grew \n abundantly and there was plenty of fod \n in the vilage. \n \n \n But gradualy things began to change. \n Somehow, the vilagers were always busy \n \n and they began to neglect the rain bird. \n \"It wil rain anyway,\" they said. \"It’s time to \n \n stop spoiling that sily old bird!\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But the people were wrong. When they\n \n stoped loking after the bird, the rain\n stoped faling. \n \n \n The crops began to dry up and die, and\n the animals grew thin and weak. Stil,\n \n nobody in the vilage went into the forest\n to fed the bird that brought the rain.\n \n Now they were al to busy trying to find\n money to buy fod in the neighbouring\n town. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One scorching day, a young girl caled Keti decided to go into the forest\n \n after schol. \"At least it wil be col in there,\" she thought to herself. She\n walked and walked, and after some time, she came to the tal tre in which\n the rain bird lived. Keti stared up at the tre. \n \n \n Sudenly, she remembered how her grany had taken her into the forest to\n fed the bird when she was stil a tiny child. Keti opened her schol bag and\n \n puled out a piece of bread left over from her lunch. Carefuly she laid the\n bread at the base of the tre. Then, because she had no thumb piano with\n \n her, she sang an old song that she had known al her life. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n With a loud whoshing sound, a beautiful\n \n blue bird swoped out of the branches\n above Keti’s head and began to eat the\n \n bread. When the bird had finished, she\n opened her mouth and sang a few pure,\n high notes. \n \n Then she raised her shiny wings and al\n of a suden Keti heard the rumble of\n \n thunder. By the time she reached her\n home, giant rain drops were pelting\n down, coling the baking red earth.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Keti was very hapy, until she told her parents what had hapened. \"Don’t\n \n be sily!\" scolded her mother. \"Nobody believes that bird has anything to do\n with the rain anymore!\" \n \n \"Your mother is right,\" said Keti’s father. \"The drought has ben broken now\n and we wil be fine. Don’t go wasting god bread feding that gredy old bird\n again!\" \n \n \n Though Keti didn’t argue with her parents, she felt sure they were wrong. \"If\n \n only Grany were stil alive,\" she said to herself, \"she would have believed\n me!\" But Keti’s grany had died a few years earlier. The only thing Keti had\n left, was her grany’s old thumb piano. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Two weks pased and there was no\n more rain. The crops began to shrivel up\n \n again and the hungry animals’ ribs began\n to stick out even more. The sun beat\n down mercilesly from a glaring blue sky.\n \n \n \"I don’t care what they say!\" thought\n \n Keti. \"We ned rain. I’m going to fed the\n bird again tomorow!\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So, early the next morning, after taking a \n \n slice of bread and a handful of red \n beries from the kitchen, Keti sliped out \n \n of the house. She began to make her way \n to the centre of the forest. \n \n \n What she didn’t realise, was that her \n father was also awake. When he saw \n \n what his daughter was doing, he realised \n that she was going to fed the rain bird \n again. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"I’l teach that disobedient child a leson!\" he said to himself angrily. He\n \n snatched his bow and arows and silently folowed Keti into the forest.\n \n \n Just as the bird flew down to eat the fod that Keti had set out for it, her\n father raised his bow and released his deadly arow. The arow flew straight\n into the bird’s heart. The bird let out a piercing shriek. \n \n \n Terified, Keti spun around − just in time to se her father fal down, stone\n \n dead. Keti screamed and turned around − just in time to se the arow fal\n harmlesly from the bird’s glosy body. Then the bird, unharmed, swoped\n up into the highest branch of the tre. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Keti raced out of the forest to a scene of\n \n uter devastation. Every animal and every\n person she saw lay dead on the ground.\n With a pounding heart, she ran al the\n \n way back to her home. \n \n She quickly found her grany’s old thumb\n \n piano. \"This is my only hope!\" she\n thought. \"The rain bird is angry. I have to\n \n make her hapy again! I HAVE to!\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Half an hour later, Keti was back at the \n base of the big tre. Her body was \n \n drenched with sweat and she was \n gasping for breath. A few paces away \n \n from her lay the lifeles body of her \n father. \n \n \n Keti loked away quickly, and with \n trembling hands, began to play the \n \n thumb piano. \n \n She played and played, until her fingers \n \n hurt. \n \n \n \n \n \n 16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Finaly, what she wanted most in the\n \n world hapened. Down swoped the bird\n as if nothing had hapened. The bird ate\n some of the beries stil lying on the\n \n ground and sang a few notes. Then, as\n Keti played on, the bird raised her wings.\n \n Keti heard a rustle behind her.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was her father who had woken up. \n \n \"I’m sory!\" he said again and again to the \n big, blue bird. \n Then he held out his hand to his \n \n daughter and they walked slowly back to \n the vilage. In the vilage al the people \n \n and animals were alive again. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 18  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n That night the vilagers held a meting.\n They al agred that they had learned a\n \n valuable leson. And from that day\n onwards, not one wek pased without a\n special trip to the forest to fed the bird\n \n that brought the rain. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 19 "
