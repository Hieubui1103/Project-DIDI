She cleaned and washed and scrubed and scoured and \n \n polished everything in sight. When she had finished, there was not a single\n speck of dust anywhere. \n The chickens poked their heads inside the front dor. \"Out!\" shouted\n \n Refiloe’s mother, \"out you scrufy things with your dirty fet and beaks!\"\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Refiloe folowed her chickens out into the yard. \n \"Mme is right, you are a disgrace,\" she scolded them \n So Refiloe thought for a while. Sudenly she smiled and said \n \n to herself, \"I have an excelent idea.\" \n She went and filed a bucket with water from the spring. \n \n Refiloe had a lot of trouble catching her chickens. They did \n not think that a bath was such a god idea. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Refiloe put the first chicken into the\n bucket of water. \n \n It clucked at the top of its voice and\n flaped its wings like crazy. \n \"Hold stil you sily thing,\" Refiloe shouted,\n \n \"this won’t take long!\" \n When Refiloe wiped the chicken’s nose\n \n and eyes it sudenly went limp and\n floped over the side of the bucket.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \"This is no time to slep,\" said Refiloe. \n \n She gave it a god shake to get al the \n water out. \n \n \n \"If you are not going to wake up now, I’l \n have to put you somewhere to dry nicely,\" \n she said. She laid the chicken out on the \n \n gras to dry. \n \n \n The chicken lay completely stil. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Refiloe washed each and every one of her chickens.\n \n Each and every one of them went limp and flopy before she\n was finished with it. \n She put al those eight chickens in a row on the gras to dry.\n \n Not one of them moved a single feather. \n \"I’l leave them to slep a litle,\" Refiloe thought to herself,\n \n and of she went to check on the moroho. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mme Ngwe and Mme Pedi were Refiloe’s \n aunts. They did not like each other at al. \n \n The aunts had ben preparing for \n months for Palesa’s weding, but they \n would not even think about riding \n \n together in the same taxi. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mme Ngwe spoted Refiloe’s chickens laid out to dry.\n \"What a nice litle snack for me to take home!\" she said to\n \n herself. \n She tok of her chale and carefuly wraped al those\n chickens up in it. \n \n Not a single chicken moved. \n \"Perfect!\" she smiled, \"now I shal put them somewhere\n \n where Mme Pedi wil not ever find them,\" and she put the\n bundle around the corner among the pumpkin vines.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mme Pedi decided to make her famous pumpkin dish. She tok her big bowl\n and went of to the vegetable garden. \n \n In the vegetable garden she saw Mme Ngwe’s bundle under the pumpkin \n vine. She undid the bundle. \n Out fel al eight chickens. \"Eish!\" she cried jumping back in surprise.\n \n \"Oh, you are the cleanest, pretiest chickens! Just ready for my pot,\" she\n croned. \n \"Now, where shal I hide you my darlings?\" Mme Pedi chuckled, \"I’l have to\n \n find a very god place,\" she said walking round the house. \n \"I know,\" she said at last, \"I’l put you on the rof!\" \n \n Mme Pedi climbed up onto the garden wal and put the chickens in a row on\n the thatched rof. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next day the sun rose in god time for the weding. Refiloe was up first\n and went to se her chickens. \n She saw that they were no longer lying on the gras. \n \n \"They must be nicely dry by now. I’m sure they have gone to lok for their\n breakfast,\" she said. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Palesa’s weding was wonderful. \n Those chickens did not get up of the rof to join in when al \n \n the bridesmaid ladies danced into the yard. \n Not one of the chickens stired when the church choir sang \n \n in their loudest, swetest voices. \n The chickens were stil lying on the rof when the priest gave \n his sermon. \n \n They did not even twitch a feather when the pigs and \n Refiloe’s grandfather al snored loudly in the midle of the \n \n sermon. \n Not one fot of those chickens trembled when shep \n wandered into the tent, nearly knocking over the weding \n \n cake. \n \n \n \n \n \n 16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was only when the grom’s father was\n halfway through his spech that things\n \n started to change on that rof. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The first chicken spread its wings and flew onto Mme Ngwe’s bosom. Mme\n Pedi next to her started gigling. \n Another chicken flew up onto Mme Ngwe’s new duku. The people at the next\n \n table tried not to laugh. \n The lady next to Mme Ngwe put her head down onto the table, \"Ai, ai,\n ai, he, he, he!\" she cackled. \n \n Al the other chickens decided to join the first two. You couldn’t se Mme\n Ngwe for al those chickens! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 18  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 19  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The guests screamed with laughter. \n \n The men had to hold onto their belies. \n The women roled around in their chairs. \n The boys and girls were hanging onto each other. \n \n The grandmothers could hardly breathe for laughing. \n The grandfathers stamped their walking sticks. \n Then the two aunts loked at each other and started gigling. Mme Pedi\n \n opened her mouth wide with laughter. Mme Ngwe threw back her head and\n laughed until al her chins shok. \n \n Refiloe couldn’t believe it! \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 20  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 21  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Al the guests agred that it was the best weding entertainment ever\n known in Malealea. \n \n \"Oh you are so lucky!\" Refiloe said to her chickens as she put them into their\n cop for the night, \"Mme says that she wil never put you in the super pot.\"\n \"But lok how dirty you are again,\" she told them, \"I think I’l have to give you\n \n another wash tomorow!\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 23 "
