Many smal animals lived \n together on the big tre. \n There also lived a family of squirels. \n \n Viki was one litle squirel among them \n who liked to talk big. His cousin, Kato \n \n from Far Forest had come to visit him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One evening, as al the animals who lived\n \n in the litle garden were just going to\n slep, they heard loud sounds from the\n park, next to the litle garden.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Kato and the other squirels saw big \n yelow machines, and men in hard yelow \n \n hats, pointing to the litle garden and \n other houses on the stret. \n They were going to pul them al down \n \n and build a parking lot. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The people who lived there would move\n \n to other houses. No one gave a thought\n to the animals, birds and insects who\n lived in the litle garden. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The machines were first spoted by the \n mole family. To be more exact, by Mister \n Poples, the eldest who told Master \n \n Moples, who in turn told the youngest, \n Litle Poples. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When they were young they were caled\n Pop, Mop and Pip. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mister Poples told the squirels, the squirels told the birds, caterpilars,\n buterflies, tiny spiders and al those who lived in the litle garden.\n \n \n There was total panic, a lot of runing, flying, scurying and hoping, with no\n one knowing what to do? Where to go? \n \n \n The caterpilars said, \"Let us lok for leaves.\" The buterflies said, \"We want\n flowers.\" The mice wanted holes. The squirels, birds, insects wanted tres,\n \n bushes and gras. \n \n \n Al the animals wanted the soft earth, not cement or concrete. \"Where wil\n we find al this?\" they cried. \"We wil surely die,\" they said and wept.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Kato's uncle and aunt were very quiet and al the litle \n squirels crept close to their mom. \n \n \n Kato cleared his throat and spoke shyly, \"I live in the Far \n \n Forest, may be we can al go there?\" \n \n There was a buz of excitement and someone said, \"How?\" \n \n \n Kato scratched his head and thought hard, \"Wel, the Squirel \n \n Expres can take the squirels and the buterflies, spiders \n caterpilars and al the insects. The birds can either fly or \n come with us. The moles, mice and the gras snake family \n \n can go by the underground Mole Expres.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Everyone thought it was a splendid idea. \n \n \n Mister Poples rushed to ask Mister Grumbles, the driver of\n the underground expres train if he could take them al to the\n \n Far Forest. Mister Grumbles fumbled, stumbled, bumbled\n before he finaly mumbled, \"Alright.\" \n \n \n Now it was Mister Poples' turn to be grand. \"Friends, you\n ned not wory, my grandfather's grandson's.third nephew's\n \n second niece's family live in the Far Forest. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n So, in the early hours of the morning the \n Squirel Expres and the Mole \n underground train with al its pasengers, \n \n chuged their way to the Far Forest with \n its tres, flowers, ponds and soft earth. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 "
