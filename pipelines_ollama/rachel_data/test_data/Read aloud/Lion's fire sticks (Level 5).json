In\n \n those days people did not have the right\n to fire. They ate their fod raw.\n \n \n Only Lion had the power of fire.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The people and the animals came \n \n together to make a plan. “What can we\n do to get the fire from Lion so that we\n can cok our fod?” they asked. \n \n They decided to wait until evening and\n started singing and singing, claping and\n claping, caling everyone together.\n \n “Come dance with us. \n Come dance with us. \n \n Come dance with us.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Many animals came from the bush to\n \n join in the dancing and singing. Lion\n brought his fire sticks. He rubed the\n \n sticks, rubed and rubed. Son a litle\n smoke apeared beneath the sticks. Lion\n blew on the smoke and aded some dry\n \n gras. \n \n \n A litle flame apeared and everyone\n brought a piece of wod. Son everyone\n was dancing around a fire. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Rabit was a cuning and fast animal. \n \n The people said to him, “While we are \n singing here and while Lion is dancing \n with us, you must take his fire sticks and \n \n run.” \n \n So Rabit grabed Lion’s fire sticks and \n \n ran. He did not make it because Lion \n caught up with him and brought the fire \n \n sticks back. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The lion sang a boastful song: \n \n “To me it does not mater. \n I don’t have a problem. \n I can eat you with hair, \n \n I can eat you without hair. \n I don’t have a problem. \n \n Al of you are fod to me.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Springbok could run and jump very fast. \n \n The people said to him, “While Lion is \n dancing and singing here with us, you \n must grab his fire sticks and run.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When they were dancing and singing, \n \n Springbok grabed the fire sticks and \n jumped away into the veld. But Lion said, \n “Why do I not hear the clipety-clop \n \n clipety-clop of Springbok’s hoves \n behind me?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Lion turned and saw Springbok runing\n into the veld with his fire sticks. So he ran\n \n after Springbok, caught him and came\n back with his fire sticks. \n \n \n Again, Lion sang his boastful song.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Then the people whispered to each other. \n They said, “Let us ask Duiker. He is smal \n \n and very fast.” “Duiker,” they said, “while \n Lion is dancing and singing here with us, \n you must grab his fire sticks and run \n \n away.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When they were dancing around the fire,\n Duiker grabed Lion’s fire sticks and ran\n \n into the veld. But Lion said, “Why do I not\n hear Duiker snort-snorting behind me as\n before?” \n \n He turned around and chased after litle\n Duiker who was leaping into the veld.\n \n Lion caught up with him and returned to\n the fire with his sticks. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Again, Lion sang his boastful song.\n \n “To me it does not mater. \n I don’t have a problem. \n I can eat you with hair, \n \n I can eat you without hair. \n I don’t have a problem. \n \n Al of you are fod to me.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Oh,” sighed the people, “Which animal \n can help us now? Ostrich has the longest \n legs of al, let us ask him.” They \n \n explained the plan to Ostrich and he \n grabed Lion’s fire sticks this time. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Lion said, “Why do I not hear Ostrich’s\n \n high singing voice behind me anymore?”\n He loked around, saw Ostrich and\n chased after him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n After a long time, Lion returned with a\n tired face, for Ostrich ran to fast for\n \n him. “From this day on,” he said, “I wil\n not leave any of you alone. I wil hunt you\n and chase you and eat you!” \n \n \n And this is how Lion came to be \n \n everyone’s enemy and how people got\n the power of fire. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14 "
