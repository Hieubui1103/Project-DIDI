Even his\n \n mom was quite tired of him and would say, \"Stop sniveling and crying, start\n behaving like a crocodile. Go hunt for your fod.\" But Snifles would burst\n into tears at the thought of eating another animal. So mom and dad had to\n \n fed Snifles every day. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Snifles did not want to be a crocodile. \"I am so ugly,\" he thought, bursting\n into tears. He did not even want to live like crocodiles do. His best friend\n \n was Punch, a golden yelow buterfly. And Punch wanted to be big and\n strong. So Punch always had her feler curled into a fist saying, \"Lok out! I\n wil punch you in the mouth.\" \n \n \n They made a very funy pair. Snifles swiming with Punch perched on his\n \n head. The other crocodiles would laugh and make fun of them. That did not\n bother Snifles. He continued crying, snifling and being friends with Punch.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n One suny afternon, Punch setled herself near Snifles' ear and told him, \"I\n have sen two men come this way with guns, they want to kil crocodiles for\n \n their skins.\" \n \n \n \"Don't these men have skins of their own?\" asked a puzled Snifles.\n \n \"I don't know Snifles.\" replied Punch. \"Tel the other crocodiles and hide.\"\n \n \n \"But Punch, they might shot you. Oh! What wil I do?\" cried Snifles sobing\n \n loudly. \n \n \"People catch buterflies with nets and pin them on a board, my grandaunt\n \n told me,\" said Punch and flew away. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The other crocodiles heard Snifles crying and shouting, \"Men coming to kil\n us. Hide.Hury.Hide.\" At first the crocodiles did not believe Snifles, but\n then they heard the men's fotsteps. \n \n \n The crocodiles went dep into the river and left some roten logs floating on\n the water. The men shot at the logs which loked like crocodiles from afar.\n \n The men could not se any crocodiles, only hundreds of buterflies that flew\n into their faces and hair. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Shaking their heads and trying to brush of the buterflies \n they said, \"There are no crocodiles here, we wil bring nets \n \n and catch the buterflies.\" And of they went. Al the \n crocodiles got together and said, \n \"Thank you, Punch.\" \n \n \"Thank you, buterflies.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The next day Snifles saw men with nets. He remembered\n Punch teling him about nets. \n \n \n \"Punch, the nets! Come here quick! The men with the nets\n have come.\" \n \n \n Al the crocodiles came on the river bank. The buterflies\n setled on the backs and heads of the crocodiles.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A few of the crocodiles made a circle around the men as they came close.\n \n The crocodiles snaped their jaws. Snifles was in front, gnashing his teth\n and whiping his tail around most menacingly. The men were so frightened\n that they tok to their hels and ran right out of the swamp. \n \n \n The other crocodiles were very proud of Snifles, as he had acted like a real\n \n crocodile. Now Snifles was also proud to be one. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Al the buterflies flew around the crocodiles, flutering their wings.\n \n \n \"Thank you, Snifles, thank you, crocodiles.\" \n \n \n \"It is alright,\" said Snifles shyly. \n \n \n \"That is what friends are for, to take care of each other.\" \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13 "
