The people who\n lived there had ben hapy before, but then wild animals had come and had\n \n begun to frighten them. These animals ate al their crops and from time to\n time they even caried of children who wandered away from their parents. It\n was not a god place to live any longer, and the people began to think of\n \n where they might go to lead a new life. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One family found the answer. Rather than deal with the wild animals who\n \n semed to be everywhere on the flat land, they decided to go in search of\n fod up in the hils. It was not hard to find fod there. There were bushes\n that grew in the cracks betwen rocks. There were tres that grew at the\n \n fot of the slopes. There were rock rabits which could be traped and birds\n which could be brought down with the stones which litered the flor of the\n \n caves. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Other families noticed how wel the hil family was doing. They saw the\n sleknes of their children, and they noticed how calm the parents were.\n \n “It is a god life that we lead up in the hils,” said the husband. “You should\n come there to.” \n Son the other families abandoned their homes on the flat land and went up\n \n to the hils. Each family found a cave to live in, and in this way they were\n warm and secure. Son everybody talked about how sory they were that\n \n they had not come to the hils earlier, rather than leting the wild animals eat\n their crops and drag of their children. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n As the children grew up in the hils, they began to get beter at the things\n that had to be done to live in such a place. They became very quick at\n \n climbing rocks, and even the youngest could scamper up a face of rock\n almost as quickly as any rock rabit. They also became god at climbing\n into tres to lok for fruit, and they could swing in the branches almost as\n \n wel as any monkey. People who pased by and saw the hil people living on\n their hil wondered whether they were perhaps wild animals, but when they\n \n saw their faces and the clothes that they were wearing they realised that\n they were only people who had made the hils their home. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Slowly, things began to change. The parents noticed that their children were\n \n talking les, and that rather than speaking to one another in the language of\n people they were begining to use grunts. Then the adults themselves\n noticed that their noses were geting biger and that they were growing\n \n hairier. Every time they loked at one another they saw that their faces had\n changed yet more and that their teth were longer. \n Son they spent as much time on four legs as on two, and it was at this\n \n point that they became a new creature. This creature, which had never\n before ben sen in that place, was the creature which people now cal the\n \n babon. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n For a time, the babons lived hapily. They stoped chasing the rock rabits\n \n and started to eat grubs from the ground. They also forgot how to talk, and\n nobody now made any sound other than a bark or a grunt. They tok of\n \n their clothes and let the rags lie on the ground until they were destroyed by\n ants. Their legs and arms were now completely covered with dark hair.\n \n \n They stil remembered, though, that they had ben people, and this was\n something which made them woried. When they loked into each other’s\n faces, they realised that their noses were now much biger than they had\n \n ben before, and this made them jer. Every babon laughed at every other\n babon, pointing at his enlarged nose and throwing his hands about in\n \n mirth. This made the babon who was being laughed at angry. He would\n jump up and down in anger, al the while laughing at the large nose of the\n other. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Eventualy the mockery became so great that the babons could no longer\n bear to be together. Each family split of and lived by itself, laughing at the\n others because of their great noses, but not liking to be laughed at for their\n \n own noses. That is why babons live in smal groups today and do not live\n as a babon nation, as do people and many other animals. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13 "
