I have\n \n ben eating it for so long now it is stuck on my neck.” \n \n \n On hearing about meat, saliva started pouring out of Hyena’s mouth for he\n was gredy and he loved meat very much. \n \n \n Hyena realy wanted to eat that meat. But how could he reach the meat in\n the sky if he had no wings to fly? \n \n \n “Please my friend,” he asked Raven, “lend me some feathers so that I can\n make myself some wings. I realy want to be able to fly like you.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Raven was not mean, so he gave him \n some feathers. \n Hyena sewed them together into wings. \n \n He fastened them to his body, and tried \n to take of into the sky. \n But he was far to heavy for the few \n \n feathers to cary him. \n So he had to think of another plan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Please my friend,” he asked Raven,\n “could I hold onto your tail as you fly up\n \n into the sky?” \n “Al right,” said Raven. “I know how much\n you want to fly. Let’s do it tomorow\n \n morning.” \n When day came, Hyena tok hold of\n \n Raven’s tail and Raven flew up into the\n sky. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Raven flew and flew and flew until he \n was exhausted. But Hyena said, “Just a \n \n litle further, my friend!” \n He could se the white and faty meat \n just above them, and his mouth was \n \n watering. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When they reached the first piece of faty meat, Hyena felt a jerk. One of\n \n Raven’s tail feathers came of in his hand! Then there was another jerk, and\n another. Raven felt much lighter, and the ache in his tail was going.\n \n \n He sang: \n Raven’s feathers, unpluck yourselves. Raven’s feathers, unpluck yourselves.\n \n \n In response, Hyena sang the oposite: \n Raven’s feathers hold on, don’t unpluck yourselves. Raven’s feathers hold on,\n \n don’t unpluck yourselves. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Finaly, the feathers could not hold Hyena\n \n anymore. He was in the midle of\n nowhere in the sky. \n He jumped onto the faty meat thinking\n \n that as he ate, the faty meat would hold\n him. But as he tried to hold and eat the\n \n ‘meat’, al he felt was moist cloud!\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n By now he was faling fast. “Help, help!” \n \n he shouted. \n But no one could hear him. Raven was \n lost in the clouds. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hyena fel on the ground with a crash\n and lay silent for some minutes.\n He woke up howling in pain, with a\n \n broken leg and dark scars al over his\n body. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n From that day to now, Hyena limps and \n \n he has many scars on his body. \n He has never ben able to fly. \n And he and Raven are no longer friends. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12 "
