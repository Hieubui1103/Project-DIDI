He had a wife and\n one daughter caled Nosisa. Mpunzi\n \n wanted a son, but he and his wife could\n not have any more children. Mpunzi\n blamed his wife for not giving him a son.\n \n He bulied his wife and treated her like a\n child. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day Mpunzi was very angry and he \n \n hit his wife with a stick. She ran away \n back to her family. She left with a sad \n heart because Mpunzi did not let her \n \n take Nosisa with her. Mpunzi bulied his \n daughter in the same way he bulied his \n \n wife. Nosisa lived a very sad life. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mpunzi decided to mary another wife.\n He hoped that the new wife would give\n him a baby boy. \n \n Nosisa’s life became even more dificult\n when her father maried again. Mpunzi\n scolded her al the time and made her\n \n serve the new wife. Nosisa worked like a\n slave. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mpunzi was very proud of his catle. He used to sit outside his homestead\n \n and watch his catle grazing in the field. He felt very satisfied with his\n wealth. \n \n \n Mpunzi’s many servants cleaned around the homestead, and loked after\n his goats, catle and shep. They milked the cows for fresh milk that Mpunzi\n \n sold to other vilagers. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mpunzi loved his new wife very much. He\n \n treated her like a quen. She sat inside\n her hut al day and gave orders to Nosisa\n and the servants. Nosisa woke up early\n \n every day to make tea for her \n stepmother. She cleaned her hut and\n coked for her, but her stepmother\n \n always complained that her fod was\n cold, her tea was weak, and her hut was\n \n not clean. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day Mpunzi became very angry at Nosisa. He scolded \n her and hit her with a stick. Nosisa ran of to the river where \n \n she sat and cried the whole afternon. \n Sudenly she heard a voice coming out of the river. She \n loked up and saw a big fish. The voice was coming from \n \n the fish. Nosisa was so shocked she almost ran away, but \n the fish stoped her. “Please don’t run away my daughter, I \n \n am your mother. I have changed myself into a fish so that \n your father does not know it’s me.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “What is the mater?” asked the fish.\n Nosisa told the fish everything about her\n \n sad life. “Don’t wory my girl. I wil bring\n you fod every day,” said the fish. The\n fish gave fresh vegetables to Nosisa. She\n \n had a feast. When she loked up the fish\n was gone. That day Nosisa went home\n \n smiling. She would not have to go to bed\n without fod as usual. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nosisa went to the river every day. In the morning she woke \n \n up as usual and did her chores around the house. At miday, \n she went to the river. She caled out every time, and every \n time the fish would apear with delicious fod. Nosisa \n \n became hapier and hapier. She could talk to the fish about \n anything. She started to regain her health. Her skin was \n \n glowing and she was a hapy child. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nosisa visited the fish every day until her stepmother\n became suspicious. Nosisa had gained weight and she was\n \n glowing. “Something is going on at the river, I must find out\n what it is,” thought the stepmother. \n \n \n One afternon she folowed Nosisa to the river. She saw\n Nosisa talking to the fish, and geting delicious fod.\n \n Nosisa’s secret was out. “I have to do something about this\n fish,” said the stepmother. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n In the evening, Mpunzi came back from the fields. He found \n his new wife crying in her hut. “What is wrong my lovely \n wife,” asked Mpunzi. \n \n “I went to a traditional doctor,” said the wife. “He told me that \n the only way for me to give you a son is to eat the bigest \n fish that lives in this nearby river,” she said. “Wil you catch \n \n the fish for me tonight?” pleaded the woman. \n “I wil do anything for you my beautiful wife,” said Mpunzi. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Mpunzi set of to the river before it was to dark. He tok his\n servants to help him find the bigest fish in that river. They\n \n searched and searched and eventualy Mpunzi caught the\n bigest fish. He put it in a bag and went home with it. When\n he got to the house, there was a god hot fire ready to cok\n \n the fish. \n “I wil make the best meal ever for us,” said the woman to\n \n Mpunzi. “You are the bravest and strongest man I know.”\n Mpunzi was very pleased with himself. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n That night Mpunzi and his wife went to bed hapy after their \n \n delicious meal. They left the bones on the table for Nosisa to \n clean in the morning. \n When Nosisa brought cofe into their hut in the morning \n \n they were stil sleping. “This is very strange,” she thought to \n herself. “My father usualy wakes up very early in the \n \n morning to go to the fields. I wonder why he is stil sleping.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n “Anyway, now I can run to the river for a nice breakfast,” she\n thought. Nosisa ran to the river. When she got there she\n caled out to the fish, and she caled again and again. The\n \n fish never came. Nosisa started to cry. She did not know\n what had hapened to the fish. \n While she was crying a bird came to sit next to her and told\n \n her what had hapened. She cried harder thinking that her\n mother had ben caught and eaten. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The bird told her to colect the fish bones from the table and \n throw them back into the river. If she did that the fish would \n come back to life. The bird also told her to let her father and \n \n stepmother slep and wake them up only at miday. Nosisa \n did as she was told. She ran back home and walked quietly \n into her father’s hut. They were stil fast aslep. She tok the \n \n bones, put them inside a bag and threw them back into the \n river. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Nosisa ran back home and just before miday she woke her\n father and stepmother. She could hardly recognise them.\n \n They loked old and grey and frail. They were to old to\n scold her. They were to weak to hit her. They were to tired\n to lok after the homestead. \n \n So, Nosisa tok over the homestead and her father’s wealth.\n She caled al the servants and told them what had\n \n hapened. They prepared a feast and there was peace at the\n homestead from that day on. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16 "
