When\n \n they served fod, Dima wondered why\n Owl’s fod tasted so god. He wondered\n if it was because the fod grew in the\n \n sun and it was coked in fire. \n Secretly, Dima made a plan. He decided\n to dance. He wanted everyone at Owl’s\n \n place to gather around him and se him\n dance. He was a god dancer. Owl and\n \n his family admired the beautiful dancing.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n When it grew dark, Owl decided to fetch \n \n the sun from his house so that he could \n stil watch Dima’s dancing. \n Owl kept the sun in an animal skin bag \n \n inside his hut. He caried the sun out \n from his house and held it high up above \n his shoulders. \n \n Now it was light. Everyone could se far \n into the distance. Son everyone was \n \n dancing in the light of the sun. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dima crept closer to the sun while he\n was dancing. Owl held on to the sun but\n \n after a while he forgot about it because\n he enjoyed the dancing so much. He saw\n how beautifuly Dima danced. He to\n \n wanted to dance like this. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Sudenly, Dima tok his fighting stick \n and hit the sun into the air like a bal. The \n sun traveled so far that it remained \n \n forever in the sky. It gave everyone light \n al day. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dima ran away so fast that Owl could not\n \n find him. \n He stayed far away for a long time. After\n \n a while, he disguised himself and went\n back to Owl’s place. \n The children recognised him and said:\n \n “There is the man who stole our sun!”\n The adults did not agre with the children\n \n and said, \n “No, this is not the man who stole our\n sun.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n They saw that this man was an old \n dancer. He wore a lot of beads around \n \n his body. They were magic dancing \n beads and they made people dance. \n It was not long before everyone was \n \n dancing. They danced the whole \n afternon, until the sun began to set. It \n \n became to dark to se the magic \n dancer. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Owl said to his wife, “Go and lok in my\n \n bag and fetch the mon.” \n Owl held the mon high above his\n shoulders and it lit up the darknes for al\n \n to se the dance. While they were\n dancing, Dima moved closer and closer\n \n to the mon, for he had a plan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n He tok his fighting stick and hit the \n mon high up into the air. Once again, he \n ran away from Owl. This time he stayed \n \n away for a very long time, until Owl’s \n family forgot al about him. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dima disguised himself again and\n \n returned to Owl’s place. \n This time he wanted Owl’s fire. Owl had\n the firesticks hanging around his neck.\n \n Dima joined Owl under a tre and the two\n men started playing an old claping\n \n game caled gi. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n They claped and claped and as they\n claped some more, Owl’s firesticks\n started jumping around his chest to the\n \n rhythm of the claping. Clap-clap, clap-\n clap. \n Dima tried to grab the firesticks, but Owl\n \n threw them over his neck so that they\n hung acros his back. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n They claped the whole day long. The rhythm of the claping made Owl\n \n forget al about the firesticks. \n \n When they swung around onto his chest once more, Dima grabed the \n \n firesticks and ran away. \n \n Owl and his family ran after Dima, but he made a clever plan. He had a bag\n \n ful of thorns and threw them onto the ground behind him. This stoped Owl\n and his family from chasing him. They could not cros the thorns on the\n \n path. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dima could not wait to make fire. He\n rubed and rubed the sticks. He blew\n and blew the ember in a litle dry gras\n \n until a tiny flame apeared. The fire grew\n and lit the whole veld and each time the\n flames reached a tre, Dima said, “From\n \n now on people wil be able to make a fire\n with each tre on earth.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A long time pased. When Dima finaly \n returned to Owl’s place, he found no one \n \n but a litle boy playing with woden \n animals. \n Dima asked the boy to show him where \n \n they kept their water. The boy led him to \n the place of water. Dima saw the big \n \n djaba, the huge clay pot in which the \n family stored water. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Dima pretended to leave for his home, but he secretly turned round to the\n place of water. He turned the huge pot over so that the water started flowing\n on the ground. \n \n Dima quickly jumped over the flowing water to the other side. \n Then he was safely acros the river of water where Owl could not find him.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n This is why the whole earth has rivers ful\n \n of water today. \n This is why we have the sun, mon and\n fire, because of the magician Dima.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17  \n Story notes \n \n \n In 203, Katunga Carimbwe told this version of the Dima and Owl origin\n story to Titu Mangumbu and Marlene Winberg in the Northern Cape \n \n Province of South Africa while he was busy painting on a canvas. \n Mangumbu, Mahongo and Winberg translated it and retold the story in this\n \n writen version with as few alterations as posible. His elders told the story\n to him during his childhod in Mavinga, Angola, where he was born in 1958.\n Most of the episodes in the Dima and Owl myth have a wide distribution in\n \n the extensive area of southern Africa and the Kalahari whose original\n inhabitants speak !Xun and other closely related languages, although the\n \n names and identities of the trickster, Dima, and his adversary change from\n area to area. \n The “claping game” mentioned in our version, Dima and Owl, is stil curent\n \n among the !xun, the Nharo, and posibly other comunities of Kalahari San.\n This story depicts Dima as a culture hero and transformer of the primeval\n world into the present world. He achieves this with words, “From now on\n \n people wil be able to make a fire with each tre on earth.” \n The Manyeka Arts Trust holds a !Xun audio teling of this story by Meneputo\n \n Mnaunga Maneka in archive. \n \n 18 \n The ilustrations in this story are from story boards by Marlene Winberg\n interpreted digitaly by Satsiri Winberg through manipulations of the\n Manyeka Art Colection of paintings made by San artists /Thalu Rumao,\n \n /Tuoi Samcuia and Joao Wene Dikuango, who have al pased away since."
