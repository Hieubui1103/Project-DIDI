The parents in this\n family woke up early every morning to\n work in the fields. They left the baby with\n \n their elder son, Sipho who was ten years\n old, and their eldest daughter Bulelwa,\n \n who was twelve years old. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The older children loved playing outside\n \n during the day and they forgot about\n doing their household chores. They\n \n caled their friends to come and play with\n them. \n \n \n The boys loved playing socer. The girls\n loved playing with dols around the yard.\n \n They forgot about loking after the baby\n when their friends arived. The baby cried\n and cried and nobody heard. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day the children put the baby under\n a tre in the shade on a bright red\n \n blanket. They went to play. The baby\n began crying as usual. \n \n \n A group of cranes flew above the\n playground and felt sory for the crying\n baby. They tried to get the children to\n \n notice that the baby was crying but the\n children kept on playing. The cranes\n \n decided to take the baby and raise it\n themselves. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Four cranes came to pick up the baby\n from under the tre. Each crane tok a\n \n corner of the baby’s blanket, lifted the\n baby up and flew away. \n \n \n The children did not notice anything\n because they were busy playing. The\n \n children’s parents were working hard in\n the hot sun. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n It was so hot that the mother decided to \n rest under a tre. While she was resting \n \n she heard \n her baby crying. She loked around and \n \n she could not se anything. \n \n Then she loked up and she saw four \n \n cranes flying away with her baby in the \n bright red blanket. She screamed and \n \n chased after the cranes. \n \n When the woman told her husband \n \n what she saw he did not believe her. \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The cranes hid the baby betwen the\n reds to protect it. They wanted to find a\n \n new family that would care for the baby.\n They fed it and put it to slep. Then they\n flew away to lok for more fod.\n \n \n The baby slept for a long time without\n \n crying. When the baby woke up it started\n crying because it was hungry. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n A big frog heard the baby’s cry. It came \n closer and saw the baby wraped in the \n \n blanket. The frog thought the cranes had \n stolen the baby, and decided to hide the \n \n baby from the cranes. \n \n Sudenly the frog heard the voices of the \n \n cranes. There was no time to hide. The \n frog swalowed the baby and hid behind \n \n a big rock. When the cranes arived they \n could not find the baby and they flew of \n to lok for it. The frog hoped back to \n \n the baby’s family home. \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The baby’s family was siting in the\n evening feling very sad. Sudenly, a big\n \n frog jumped through the dor. The frog\n told them about how it swalowed their\n \n baby. They beged the frog to give them\n the baby. \n \n \n “Give me thre flies to eat then I wil give\n you the baby,” said the frog.” The father\n \n caught thre flies and fed them to the\n frog. The frog coughed and the baby\n poped out. The family and the frog\n \n jumped and danced with joy. \n \n \n \n \n \n 8 "
