One was caled \n Magezi Matala Manene, the other was \n \n caled Kasiru Kasira Katono. \n \n They used to live by sharing. Their \n \n friendship was so dep that they could \n share one white ant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n One day, Magezi Matala Manene made a\n sugestion.“Why don’t we dig together as\n we eat together?” he asked. \n \n \n Kasiru Kasira Katono replied, “God\n idea. We should also store our fod\n \n together.” They both agred to this.\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene asked his \n friend, “Ee! Who wil start the diging? \n \n Why don’t you dig, and I wil come to \n sow?” \n \n \n “Yes,” replied Kasiru Kasira Katono, and \n she dug a big garden. \n \n \n Then she told her friend, “Magezi \n Matala Manene, I have finished diging. \n \n Come and sow milet.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 3  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene said, “You go on\n \n with the sowing, I wil come and wed.”\n \n \n So Kasiru Kasira Katono went on with\n the sowing. When she finished she told\n her friend, “Gras has started to grow. Go\n \n and wed.” \n \n \n But Magezi Matala Manene replied, “No,\n you go on with weding. I wil harvest.”\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 4  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Kasiru Kasira Katono went on with the \n \n weding until the milet was ripe. \n \n At harvesting time she went to her friend \n \n and said, “Magezi Matala Manene, I \n cultivated, and sowed, and weded. Now \n \n come and harvest the milet.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 5  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene replied, “Not at\n \n al, I have no time! You go on and\n harvest. I wil put it in the granary.”\n \n \n Kasiru Kasira Katono acepted this. She\n harvested the milet and tok it home.\n \n She caled Magezi Matala Manene and\n said, “My friend, I have finished\n \n harvesting. Come and take the milet to\n the granary.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene replied, “I \n canot lift al that milet. You put it in the \n \n granary. I wil come during pounding.” \n \n Kasiru Kasira Katono said to her friend, \n \n “It sems you are simply tricking me.” \n \n Magezi Matala Manene replied, “No it’s \n \n not true! Give me just one milet finger \n and you take the rest. I wil pay you \n \n back.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 7  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Kasiru Kasira Katono was not mean. She\n \n gave Magezi Matala Manene one finger\n of milet, and they parted ways.\n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene moved on, \n moved on, moved on! He found a hen\n scratching the soil and eating stones. He\n \n said, “My in-law hen, instead of eating\n soil, have some of my milet.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 8  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Hen tok the milet and ate. Magezi \n \n Matala Manene loked and saw that the \n hen had eaten al the milet. \n \n \n He cried out, “Wuwi! You have eaten al \n my milet. The milet was not mine, I \n \n borowed it from Kasiru Kasira Katono.” \n \n \n Hen beged, “Since it is time for laying, I \n wil lay one eg for you to take instead.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9  \n \n \n \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene got an eg from\n the hen. He moved on, moved on, moved\n on! \n \n \n He found some children shoting \n \n mangoes in a tre using stones. He told\n them, “If you want those mangoes to fal,\n you should use this eg to shot them\n \n down.” \n \n \n He gave them the eg. When they used it\n to shot the mangoes, it hit a branch and\n broke. The eg driped down and the\n \n shel remained in the branches. \n \n \n \n \n \n 10  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene cried out, \n “Wuwi! You have broken my eg! The \n \n hen gave me the eg, but it was not \n mine. The eg was for the milet the hen \n ate. The milet was not mine. I borowed \n \n the milet from Kasiru Kasira Katono.” \n \n The children whispered, “Don’t shout like \n \n that. The owner of the mangoes wil find \n us here. Instead of the eg take this \n \n mango.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1  \n \n Magezi Matala Manene moved on, \n \n moved on, moved on! He came acros a\n parot eating an insect. “Have you ever\n sen such a mango as this?” he asked\n \n the parot. \n \n \n When the parot tok the mango, its\n sharp beak pierced the skin and the fruit\n burst open. \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene cried out,\n “Wuwi! You have burst my mango! The\n \n children gave me the mango, but it was\n not mine. The mango was for the eg the\n \n children broke. The hen gave me the eg,\n but it was not mine. The eg was for the\n milet the hen ate. The milet was not\n \n mine. I borowed the milet from Kasiru\n Kasira Katono.” \n \n \n 12  \n \n \n \n \n The parot plucked out its most beautiful \n feather saying, “Here, take my feather \n \n instead of the mango.” \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene tok the feather \n and moved on, moved on, moved on. He \n came to a lake. When he was crosing, \n \n the feather sliped out of his hand and \n into the lake. He could not get the feather \n back. \n \n \n So he filed his mouth with water and \n \n kept it in his cheks until he reached dry \n land. There he found the charcoal \n burners with their fire. \n \n \n \n \n \n 13  \n \n \n \n \n He opened his mouth, the water came\n out, and splashed on to the fire. The fire\n \n went out. The charcoal burners were\n pleased. \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene cried out,\n “Wowe! Your fire has taken my water. I\n \n got the water from the lake, but it was\n not mine. The water was for the feather\n that the lake tok. The feather was for\n \n the mango that the parot burst. The\n mango was for the eg that the children\n \n broke. The eg was for the milet that the\n hen ate. The milet was not mine. I\n borowed the milet from Kasiru Kasira\n \n Katono.” \n \n \n \n 14  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The charcoal burners said, “Here, take \n \n this axe instead of the water.” \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene tok the axe and \n moved on, moved on, moved on! He \n came acros butchers slaughtering a \n \n bul. \n \n \n He told the butchers, “Here is an axe for \n you to cut up the meat.” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 15  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n While the butchers were cuting the\n meat, the axe broke. Magezi Matala\n \n Manene cried out, “Wowe! You have\n broken my axe. I got the axe from the\n \n charcoal burners, but it was not mine.\n The axe was for the water that the fire\n tok. The water was for the feather that\n \n the lake tok. The feather was for the\n mango that the parot burst. The mango\n \n was for the eg that the children broke.\n The eg was for the milet that the hen\n ate. The milet was not mine. I borowed\n \n the milet from Kasiru Kasira Katono.”\n \n \n \n \n \n 16  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n The butchers said, “Here, take the head \n \n and tail of the bul instead.” \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene moved on, \n moved on, moved on! Until he got to a \n mudy swamp. \n \n \n He put the head of the bul on the mud. \n \n He also placed the tail in the mud. It \n loked as if the bul was stuck in the \n mud. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 17  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene began to shout,\n “Wu-lululu! Wu-lululu, wulululu! The king’s\n \n bul has got stuck in the mud!” \n \n Al the vilagers came runing. What\n \n concerns the king, concerns everyone. A\n crowd son gathered around the head\n and tail. \n \n \n They started asking, “Now what do we\n \n do?” \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 18  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene advised, “Some \n of you pul the tail, and some of you pul \n \n the head. We wil pul the bul from the \n mud.” \n \n \n The people tok his advice. “Ready! One, \n two, thre, pul! Come out now!” \n \n they shouted. \n \n \n The vilagers fel down over each other \n from the efort of puling. Two were stil \n holding the head. One held up the tail. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 19  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Magezi Matala Manene cried out, “Wo\n we! You have puled apart the king’s\n \n bul. Each one of you must give one bul\n for the king.” \n \n \n Quickly, the people went back to their\n homes. Quickly, they returned with a bul\n \n each. \n \n \n And so Magezi Matala Manene left with\n a herd of buls to return to his friend\n Kasiru Kasira Katono. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 20 "
