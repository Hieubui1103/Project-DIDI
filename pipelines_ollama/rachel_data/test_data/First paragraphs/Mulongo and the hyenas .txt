 There was once a girl caled 
 
 Mulongo who lived with her parents 
 
 near the vilage of Budongo. 
 
 
 One day Mulongo's mother sent her 
 to fetch water at the wel. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On the way, she met her friends.
 
 They were going to the forest to get
 firewod. Mulongo wanted to go 
 
 with them. 
 
 
 "Please wait for me under this 
 
 muvule tre!" she said, "I have to
 fetch water for my mother." 
 
 
 But her friends didn’t want to wait.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 "Al right, I’l catch up with you in the 
 forest!" said Mulongo. 
 
 She ran of to fetch water and take it 
 to her mother. 
 
 
 Then she went to the forest to lok 
 
 for her friends. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She folowed a path that led to a
 
 stream. 
 
 
 On the other side of the stream were
 many tiny paths each one, leading in
 
 a diferent direction. 
 
 
 "Which path had her friends taken?"
 
 she wondered. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She chose the bigest path, and 
 walked and walked, but she could 
 
 not find her friends. 
 
 
 She was so tired that when she sat 
 under a tre to rest, she fel fast 
 
 aslep. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Mulongo woke up, it was dark.
 In the darknes, yelow eyes were
 
 gleaming. She was surounded by 
 
 hyenas! 
 
 
 She was to terified even to cry out.
 She tried runing, but the hyenas
 
 circled her hungrily. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 "Don’t move," said the gruf voice of 
 
 the bigest hyena. 
 "If you run, we’l eat you!" 
 
 "Please let me go home!" Mulongo 
 pleaded. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But instead the hyenas tok 
 Mulongo to their house in the forest.
 
 It was a dirty hut ful of bones and
 buzing flies. 
 
 
 She lay down and pretended to go to
 
 slep. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In the darknes, she heard the 
 
 hyenas talking to each other. 
 "How is the fire doing?" one hyena 
 
 asked. "Is the water boiling?" 
 
 "Everything is ready," was the reply. 
 "Should I bring her?" 
 
 "Yes, yes!" growled the other hyenas. 
 "We’re hungry!" 
 
 They were ready to drag Mulongo 
 out of the hut. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 But the big hyena spoke, "Hyenas,
 
 wait. Remember the rule of the 
 vilage. No hyena may eat alone. We
 
 have to invite the whole family to
 share a meal." 
 
 "I’l go and cal the in-laws," said his
 wife. 
 
 "I’l go and fetch my cousins," said
 the smal hyena. 
 
 "I’l fetch our brothers and sisters,"
 
 said another. 
 "And I wil remain here with our
 
 fod," said the big hyena. 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The big hyena sat in the dorway of 
 the hut and the others went of in 
 
 diferent directions. 
 
 
 They tok a long time, and the big 
 
 hyena began to doze in front of the 
 warm fire. Son he was snoring. 
 
 
 This was Mulongo's chance! But 
 
 how was she going to get past the 
 hyena? He was so big he filed the 
 
 whole dorway. 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 There was only one way. 
 
 
 She tok a flying leap right over the
 
 hyena’s back, and ran as fast as her
 legs could cary her. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Just then the other hyenas returned, 
 
 and saw what had hapened. They 
 
 ran after her, howling with anger and 
 disapointment. 
 
 
 But it was to late. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As she came to her vilage, one of
 
 the vilagers recognised her and
 shouted, "Mulongo, Mulongo is 
 
 coming, Mulongo is coming." 
 Her father and mother ran out to
 
 met her. They huged her, while
 thanking God for saving their child,
 
 "Mulongo, Mulongo, we thought you
 
 had died!" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 From that day, Mulongo and the other children never again went back to the forest alone.
