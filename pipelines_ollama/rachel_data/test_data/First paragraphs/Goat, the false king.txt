 Once upon a time, there was a goat
 
 caled Igodhobe. 
 
 
 Igodhobe the goat was the king of
 
 farm animals and birds. He lived a
 god life. 
 
 
 One day, Igodhobe the goat caled
 
 al the animals and birds to a 
 meting. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “My friends, I have caled you 
 
 because I had a dream,” said 
 
 Igodhobe the king. 
 
 
 Al the animals and birds kept quiet. 
 They listened to their king carefuly. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “I dreamed that there was no fod or
 water left in the land. Many of our
 
 relatives died!” said Igodhobe the
 
 king. 
 
 
 When the animals and the birds 
 heard the dream, they were woried.
 
 “What shal we do?” asked the cat.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The hen and the duck had an idea. 
 
 They said, “Let each one of us bring 
 fod and put it in the king’s store.” 
 
 
 Al the animals agred with this idea. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Igodhobe the king made a rule. He
 
 said, “Get ropes. Tie up anyone who
 does not bring fod to my store.
 
 Then cary him to me.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Son after this, it was time for a new 
 
 king to rule over the farm. Al the 
 animals and birds met and elected 
 
 the cat as their new king. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But Igodhobe the goat refused to
 
 agre that the cat was king. 
 
 
 “I’m the king. There is no other king.
 
 I can’t obey any other animal,” said
 Igodhobe the goat. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The animals tok fod to the new 
 king’s store. But Igodhobe the goat 
 
 did not take anything. 
 
 
 “When Igodhobe the goat was king, 
 
 we al obeyed him. Now he does not 
 want to obey our new king. What 
 
 shal we do to him?” asked the cow. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Al the domestic animals and birds
 were angry. “He thinks he is diferent
 
 to us,” they al mutered. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The dog said, “I helped him when he 
 was king. I did not slep at night. I 
 
 was always with him, ready to help.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The shep said, “I gave him my wol
 to cover his children.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The pig said, “When he was king, he 
 
 told his friends that I eat a lot. But I 
 was often in his garden diging and 
 
 weding his maize and milet.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The shep asked, “What did he say?
 That you eat a lot? Did he think that
 
 he wil be king forever?” 
 
 
 Then the shep aded, “Let him 
 
 understand that he is not king any
 more. I don’t know why he thinks he
 
 is so important.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Al the animals laughed and agred 
 
 that Igodhobe the goat must take 
 
 fod to the new king. 
 
 
 King Cat ordered Igodhobe to 
 come to him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When the animals went to fetch 
 
 Igodhobe the goat, he was siting
 on a chair with his legs crosed. The
 
 cow told Igodhobe what the new 
 
 king said. 
 
 
 “I shal not go to the cat. There is no
 other king except me. When you 
 
 become a king, you are always a 
 king,” replied Igodhobe the goat.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “We wil tie you with ropes and take 
 you to the new king,” said the shep. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 16  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 So the cow tied Igodhobe the goat
 
 to her tail. She then puled 
 Igodhobe to the king. 
 
 
 
 The shep, the duck, the dog, the
 pig, and the cock chered as the
 
 cow puled the goat. 
 
 
 They al shouted together, “Take this
 stuborn goat to our new king!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 17  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 From that time, every goat refuses 
 
 to move when it is puled. It thinks 
 that you are taking it to the king’s 
 
 court.
