 Once upon a time there lived two 
 
 friends, Hyena and Hare. 
 
 
 Hyena was a hardworking farmer. 
 
 He woke up early every morning and 
 went to work in his field. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hare woke up when it was already
 
 broad daylight. He would yawn and
 stretch. Then he would go loking
 
 for fod. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Most mornings, Hare would take 
 
 some seds from Hyena’s granary. 
 
 Then he went to his field and 
 pretended to work. He would light a 
 
 fire and roast the seds. He did 
 nothing, except eat roasted seds. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 At harvest time, Hare went and stole
 his friend’s ripe maize. He caried it
 
 to his own granary. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hyena complained about the stolen 
 
 crops. Hare answered, “Maybe the 
 neighbours stole your maize. They 
 
 are sufering from famine because 
 they are lazy.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hyena thought about this problem
 for a long time. He came up with an
 
 idea. 
 
 
 He colected gum from the tres. He
 
 put that sticky gum around the 
 whole field. The thief would get
 
 stuck in the gum. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 During the night, Hare went to 
 
 Hyena’s field to steal more maize. 
 Before entering the field he loked 
 
 around to se if it was safe. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hare did not se the gum that Hyena
 
 had put around the field. Hare stod
 in the gum and was stuck. He 
 
 started shouting for help. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hyena heard the shouts and ran out 
 
 to catch the thief. 
 
 
 He could not believe his eyes. It was 
 
 his friend Hare who was stuck in the 
 gum! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 From that time, Hyena went his way and Hare went the other way. 
 
 
 That marked the end of their friendship.
