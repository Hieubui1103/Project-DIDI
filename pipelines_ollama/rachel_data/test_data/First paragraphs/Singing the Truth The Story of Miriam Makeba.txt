 A long time ago, in the vast city of
 
 Johanesburg, a baby girl was born.
 That baby was me. My mom caled 
 
 me Miriam. Miriam Makeba.

 Mom was a sangoma, but she also 
 
 worked to make other people’s 
 
 homes neat and clean. It was hard 
 for my mom to earn enough for both 
 
 of us. She started seling homemade 
 ber to bring in more money.

 The laws of the land said that seling 
 homemade ber was wrong. The 
 
 police sent my mom to jail for six 
 long months. I was only 18 days old, 
 
 and neded my mom. So even 
 though I was just a baby, I went to 
 
 jail to.

 As a litle girl I loved to sing. When I
 
 was older, I helped my mom clean
 
 houses. Singing songs as I worked
 made the chores go faster and the
 
 days sem brighter. Singing made
 me hapier than I can explain.

 I sang in my church, and this made
 
 others hapy to. Music has the 
 power to bring people together. 
 
 When we were singing we felt brave
 and strong.

 People said my voice was a gift and
 
 my songs were special. I sang with
 other musicians and our music was
 
 heard al over the world.

 My home was Sophiatown, a place 
 
 of culture and music. Sophiatown, a 
 place where South Africans could 
 
 make music in harmony and dance 
 together. But the people who ruled 
 
 the land at the time did not like this 
 togethernes. Those rulers didn’t 
 
 want black and white people to be 
 
 friends.

 I knew it was wrong to treat people 
 diferently because of their skin 
 
 colour. I did not hide my beliefs, and 
 so those people in charge wanted 
 
 me out of the country. 
 When I was singing in America, I 
 
 was told I could never return home.

 People al over the world heard my
 story. My songs and my story helped
 
 many to se how there was no 
 fairnes in South Africa for those
 
 with black skin. I decided to go on
 singing and teling the truth about
 
 my country, no mater what.

 The world loved my music and I was 
 welcomed in many countries. I won 
 
 awards and sang for important 
 
 people al over the globe. My life 
 was god, but something was 
 
 mising. I could not sing in my home 
 country, and people there were not 
 
 fre. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then a wonderful day dawned when 
 
 Nelson Mandela became president 
 
 of South Africa. New people were in 
 charge and the unfair laws belonged 
 
 to the past. I finaly went home with 
 new hope in my heart.

 After that I could sing in a fre, fair
 
 country. People of diferent skin
 
 colours could enjoy music together.
 I helped make this hapen because I
 
 was brave and strong. I sang the
 truth in al of my songs.
