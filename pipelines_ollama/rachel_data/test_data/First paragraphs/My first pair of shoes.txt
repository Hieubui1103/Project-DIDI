 I had never worn shoes before. 
 
 
 
 When I saw children wearing nice 
 shoes, I would lok at them with 
 
 longing.

 My mother would say, “You wil have
 many pairs in the future, just wait!”
 
 
 Sometimes I did not believe her.
 
 “When is the future?” I asked her one
 day.

 Time pased and it was nearly 
 
 Christmas. 
 
 
 Everybody was busy going to the 
 
 market and coming back with bags 
 of new things. 
 
 
 “Mother, are we going to the 
 
 market?” I asked her.

 The day before Christmas, my 
 mother woke me up earlier than 
 
 usual. 
 
 
 She asked me to fetch 
 
 the big shoping basket she 
 always caried to the market.

 At the open-air market there were 
 
 many parents with their children. 
 
 
 They were buying new clothes and 
 
 stocking up on fod. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We went straight to where there 
 were many diferent types of shoes.
 
 
 My eyes were wide with amazement.
 
 I gaped at row after row of neatly
 aranged shoes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 After trying on many pairs, I setled 
 for black lace-up shoes. 
 
 
 At home that night, I couldn’t slep. 
 
 I was so excited thinking of how I 
 would wear my new shoes and show 
 
 of to every child in the vilage. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 After a while, I got out of bed and
 
 put on the shoes. 
 
 
 I walked slowly around the rom 
 and then put the shoes back into
 
 the box. 
 
 
 I lay down again, but I couldn’t slep.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I got up and tried on the shoes a 
 
 second time. 
 
 
 I struted around the rom for a 
 
 while and then put them back. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I lay down once more and tried to
 slep. But I got up a third time.
 
 
 I put on the shoes and jumped 
 
 around the rom. Then I felt tired.
 
 
 I decided to get back into bed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The folowing morning, I was woken 
 
 by my mother. “What is this I se?” 
 she asked. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I was wearing my new shoes in bed!
