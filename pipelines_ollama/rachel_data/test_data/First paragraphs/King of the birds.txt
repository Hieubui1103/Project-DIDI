 Once long ago, the birds had a 
 
 meting. They wanted a king, just
 like people and animals. 
 
 
 Which bird should be king? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 "Eagle, he is strong and kingly!" said 
 
 one bird. 
 
 
 "No, he has no crown, and when he 
 cals, he sounds to sad," said 
 
 another. 
 
 
 "Then Ostrich, because he is the 
 largest and roars like a lion," one 
 
 caled out. 
 
 
 "No, he can't fly. The king of the birds 
 
 must be able to fly." 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 "I think I should be king," said
 Peacock, faning his tail. "I am so
 
 beautiful." 
 
 
 "You are to proud," said Owl. "I have
 the largest eyes of any bird. I should
 
 be king." 
 
 
 "No, not you, Owl," the other birds
 
 shouted. "You go to slep when the
 sun rises!" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 And so they didn’t get very far with 
 
 chosing a king. 
 
 
 Then one bird had an idea. "The one 
 who can fly the highest wil be king," 
 
 she said. 
 
 
 "Yes, yes," al the birds shouted, and 
 
 they al flew up, up, into the sky. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Gose flew for one day, straight over
 the highest mountains in the world.
 
 
 Eagle flew for two days, into the sky
 
 high above the mountains. 
 
 
 But Vulture soared for thre whole
 days without stoping, straight 
 
 toward the sun. Far above them, the
 
 birds heard Vulture cry, "I am the
 highest, I am king!" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But then just above him Vulture 
 heard a tiny voice, "Tink, tink, tink! I
 
 am the highest, I am king." It was
 
 Ncede, the smalest bird of al.
 
 
 He had held onto the great wing 
 feathers of Vulture as he soared into
 
 the sky. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 "You won’t beat me again," said 
 Vulture, and flew straight up into the 
 
 air. 
 
 
 He flew up and up until he could fly 
 no more. "I am higher than any other 
 
 bird. I am your king!" he cried. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But out from under Vulture's wing
 crept the tiny bird. "Tink, tink! Tink,
 
 tink! It is I, the smalest one! I am
 your king." 
 
 
 Vulture was to exhausted to fly any
 
 further. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 So down he sailed - with the litle 
 bird stil under his wing. 
 
 
 The other birds were furious with 
 
 Ncede. 
 They waited for him, ready to pluck 
 
 out al his feathers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But quick litle Ngcede saw how 
 angry the other birds were, and flew 
 
 into an empty snake hole. 
 
 
 The waiting birds told Owl, "With 
 your big eyes, you must kep guard 
 
 at the hole and catch him when he 
 comes out." 
 
 
 
 So Owl sat in front of the hole. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But the sun was warm and son Owl 
 
 fel fast aslep. 
 
 
 Litle Ngcede peped out of the 
 
 snake hole. When he saw that Owl 
 was aslep, he flew up and away. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Owl was very ashamed that he had
 let the litle bird escape. 
 
 
 
 Now he only hunts at night. 
 
 
 In the day, he sleps, away from the
 sight of the other birds.
