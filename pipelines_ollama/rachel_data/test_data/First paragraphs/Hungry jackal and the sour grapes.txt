 Once upon a time there was a 
 hungry jackal. He was walking 
 
 around the bush loking for fod.

 He came upon a big orchard of fresh 
 ripe grapes. He spoted a bunch of 
 
 grapes hanging from a high branch.

 "Those lok realy delicious," he
 
 thought to himself.? He tok a few
 steps back so that he could make
 
 his highest jump.

 The grapes were to high. Jackal fel 
 on his back without geting to the 
 
 grapes.

 Jackal got up and went further back
 
 from his starting spot. This time he
 was planing to jump higher. He 
 
 almost got high enough but he fel
 harder on his back.

 He tried again and again, but 
 couldn't get to the grapes. He kept 
 
 faling until his back was very sore.

 Finaly, he gave up and walked away.

 Jackal was not hapy at al. He 
 
 stoped, loked back at the grapes 
 
 and thought, "Those grapes lok 
 realy sour anyway." He caried on 
 
 walking. He was hungrier than 
 before.
