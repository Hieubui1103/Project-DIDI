 This is the story of Keper 
 and his nursery for 
 
 orphaned animals. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 August was a busy month 
 for Keper and his helpers 
 
 at the nursery. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One year old Mkite 
 arived first. She came 
 
 in an old gren truck. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Keper and his helpers 
 were very sory for Mkite. 
 
 She was so thin and sad. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But son, Mkite got stronger. 
 She began to play with the 
 
 other animals at the nursery. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On another day in August, 
 a helicopter landed at the 
 
 nursery. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Keper and his helpers rushed 
 
 outside. 
 
 
 In the helicopter was a smal 
 elephant under big blanket. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ndiwa was under the blanket. 
 
 He was five days’ old. 
 Keper fed Ndiwa with 
 
 a botle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The third orphan that month 
 
 was Malea. She arived at 
 the nursery on a red tractor. 
 
 She was six months’ old. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Malea the rhinoceros son became
 
 close friends with 
 
 Enkare, a baby bufalo. 
 They went everywhere 
 
 together. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One night, everybody was 
 woken up by the arival of 
 
 Ambia. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Ambia was five months’ old. 
 
 She was weak after her long 
 journey. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Because of her long neck, 
 Keper held the botle high 
 
 to fed Ambia. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Tiny twins Abei and Moit 
 arived in the midle of 
 
 August. 
 
 
 These antelopes were only 
 a few hours’ old. They were 
 
 very sick. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Everyone was sad when Abei 
 
 died a wek after he arived 
 
 at the nursery. 
 
 
 But Keper and his helpers 
 saved Moit. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The last orphans to arive in August
 
 were Kopi, Kepi and 
 Keji. 
 
 
 These cubs were two weks’ 
 
 old. 
 
 
 They were very hungry when 
 
 they arived. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 16  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Keper and his helpers love 
 al of the animals, even the naughty
 
 ones. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 17  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The naughtiest baby was 
 
 Lobolia. 
 
 
 Lobolia liked to hide Keper's 
 glases. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 18  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The people at the nursery 
 
 work hard to lok after 
 the baby animals. 
 
 
 
 They hope that one day 
 the orphans can lok after 
 
 themselves. 
 
 
 Then these animals can 
 return to the wild.
