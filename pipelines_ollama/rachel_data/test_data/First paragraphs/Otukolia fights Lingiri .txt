 There existed a monstrous animal 
 caled Lingiri. It lived in a cave at the 
 
 fot of a mountain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lingiri swalowed al the people on
 
 the earth. 
 
 
 Except one pregnant woman. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This expectant mother lived alone 
 near a forest. She would go to 
 
 colect firewod to cok her fod. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One time when she went to colect
 
 firewod, she colected a heap that
 
 was to heavy for her to cary. She
 said to herself aloud, “Who wil help
 
 me raise this firewod on to my 
 head?” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 It so hapened that the day for this 
 mother to deliver was due. When the 
 
 pregnant woman was strugling to 
 lift the firewod, the child jumped 
 
 out and said, “Mother, let me lift for 
 you.” 
 
 
 Since the child stil had the umbilical 
 
 cord, she named him Otukolia. His 
 
 name meant ‘one with a long uncut 
 umbilical cord.’ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Otukolia had grown up a bit,
 he asked his mother, “Eya, I se
 
 only you and me, where are some of
 our people?” 
 
 
 His mother replied, “Grow up a bit
 
 more.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Each time Otukolia pestered his 
 
 mother to tel him where their 
 relatives were. But his mother would 
 
 always reply, “Grow up a bit more.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When his mother saw that the boy
 
 had grown up and was able to 
 defend himself, she told him about
 
 the monstrous animal. 
 
 
 “This monster has swalowed 
 
 everyone. It lives in a cave at the
 fot of the mountain. The people are
 
 stil alive in the monster!” said the
 woman. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When he was about seventen, 
 
 Otukolia started making many sharp 
 razor blades. 
 
 
 When he was fuly prepared, he 
 
 climbed up the mountain and sat on 
 a stone and started caling Lingiri in 
 
 a loud voice, “Li-ngi-ri-ri-ri, Li-ng-i-ri-i- 
 
 i-i.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 When Lingiri heard the cal, he 
 
 responded “Yiyiyiyiyi -yi-yi-yi-yi,” and
 his voice shok the earth. 
 
 
 He asked, “I’ve eaten al the Bari. I’ve
 
 eaten al the Ndrua. I’ve eaten al the
 Ma’di. Who is caling me up there?”
 
 
 Otukolia caled again and Lingiri
 
 responded asking the same 
 
 question, “Who is caling me up 
 there?” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lingiri walked out of his cave. His 
 long tongue stretched out towards 
 
 Otukolia, ready to eat him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lingiri atempted to lick up Otukolia
 
 with his tongue. But each time, 
 Otukolia cut Lingiri’s tongue with the
 
 sharp razor blades. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lingiri’s tongue got smaler and 
 
 weaker until the monster died. 
 
 
 Otukolia tok a machete and cut 
 open the monster’s tumy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Al the people in Lingiri’s tumy
 
 came out with great joy. They 
 
 thanked him for liberating them.
 
 
 Otukolia became their king for 
 defeating Lingiri.
