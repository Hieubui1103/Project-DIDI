 It was a very hot Saturday afternon 
 in December. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Bontle and Mpho and Lerato, go out 
 
 and play!” Mme said to us. 
 
 “I don’t want you under my fet.” 
 
 
 We ran out of the house. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Let’s go to the river,” Lerato said.
 “It’s coler there.” 
 
 “But Mme told us not to swim in the
 river,” said Bontle. 
 
 “We won’t swim,” answered Lerato.
 “We’l just play in the shade next to
 
 the water.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But playing libeke is hot work, even 
 when you’re under the tres next to 
 
 the river. 
 
 First we tok of our shoes. 
 But we were stil hot. 
 
 Then we tok of our shirts and 
 skirts. 
 
 But we were stil hot. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We put our fet in the river to col 
 
 of. 
 Then we splashed each other. 
 
 Son we were soaked with water. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Oh come on! ?Let’s swim,” said 
 
 Mpho. “Mme wil never know.” 
 We swam and swam and forgot 
 
 about the time. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The sun started to go down, and the
 
 day began to col. 
 
 
 Where were our clothes? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We loked under the tres. 
 We loked on the bushes. 
 
 We loked everywhere. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 There were some cows near the 
 river, enjoying the swet gras.
 
 Bontle loked up, “Lok at that cow!
 
 What’s in her mouth?” 
 “She’s eating a red flower,” said
 
 Lerato. 
 “It’s not a red flower,” shouted Mpho.
 
 “It’s your shirt!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We loked at another cow who was
 
 chewing something blue. 
 “That’s my skirt!” shouted Bontle.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We went home in our panties, 
 
 shivering. But not only because it 
 
 was col. 
 “It was the cows,” we cried. “The 
 
 cows ate our clothes.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But did Mme believe us? 
 
 Son our botoms were very warm.
 
 
 And it wasn’t from the sun.
