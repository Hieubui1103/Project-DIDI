 Long long ago people didn't know
 anything. They didn't know how to
 
 plant crops, or how to weave cloth,
 
 or how to make iron tols. 
 
 
 The god Nyame up in the sky had al
 the wisdom of the world. He kept it
 
 safe in a clay pot.

 One day, Nyame decided that he 
 would give the pot of wisdom to 
 
 Anansi. 
 
 
 Every time Anansi loked in the clay
 pot, he learned something new. It
 
 was so exciting!

 Gredy Anansi thought, “I’l kep the
 pot safe at the top of a tal tre.
 
 Then I can have it al to myself!”
 
 
 He spun a long thread, wound it 
 
 round the clay pot, and tied it to his
 stomach. 
 
 
 He began to climb the tre. But it
 
 was hard climbing the tre with the
 pot bumping him in the knes al the
 
 time.

 Al the time Anansi's young son had
 
 ben standing at the botom of the
 tre watching. He said, “Wouldn't it
 
 be easier to climb if you tied the pot
 to your back instead?” 
 
 
 Anansi tried tying the clay pot ful of
 
 wisdom to his back, and it realy was
 
 a lot easier.

 In no time he reached the top of the
 
 tre. 
 But then he stoped and thought,
 
 “I'm suposed to be the one with al
 the wisdom, and here my son was 
 
 cleverer than me!” 
 Anansi was so angry about this that
 
 he threw the clay pot down out of
 
 the tre. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 It smashed into pieces on the 
 
 ground. The wisdom was fre for 
 everyone to share. 
 
 
 
 
 And that is how people learned to
 farm, to weave cloth, to make iron
 
 tols, and al the other things that
 
 people know how to do.
