 A long time ago, in the vilage of
 Nyamani, there lived a man known
 
 as Kiundu. 
 
 
 He liked to eat very much. He 
 especialy liked to eat meat. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One day, the chief of the vilage 
 invited al the vilagers to his son’s 
 
 weding. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kiundu also heard people talking
 
 about another weding party in a
 
 nearby vilage caled Katumbi. 
 
 
 “Two parties on the same day!” 
 Kiundu thought. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “I must atend both parties,” Kiundu
 
 said to himself. 
 
 
 “I wil first walk to Katumbi and then
 come back to Nyamani.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kiundu woke up early in the morning 
 and walked to Katumbi vilage. 
 
 
 
 When he arived he saw that the 
 coks were stil preparing the fod. 
 
 
 “I wil go back to Nyamani and return 
 
 here later,” Kiundu decided. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kiundu walked back to Nyamani 
 hoping to find the meat ready. 
 
 
 He was now hungry. 
 
 
 But when he arived, people there
 
 were also stil preparing the fod.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “When I left Katumbi they were 
 
 starting to cok,” he thought. “The 
 
 fod must be ready now.” So Kiundu 
 walked back to Katumbi. 
 
 
 He was now very hungry. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 By the time Kiundu got to Katumbi,
 people had already eaten. 
 
 
 
 Guests were giving presents to the
 bride and the grom. 
 
 
 Kiundu did not have a gift to give. He
 
 only wanted to eat. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kiundu was most disapointed 
 about mising the fod. 
 
 
 
 He decided to walk back to Nyamani
 vilage. 
 
 
 He was hungry and tired and walked
 
 very slowly. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When he arived at Nyamani vilage, 
 
 people were singing and dancing. 
 
 
 They had already eaten al the fod! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When he heared that there was no 
 fod, Kiundu fainted. 
 
 
 
 He had mised meat from both 
 parties. 
 
 
 When he recovered, he got some 
 
 poridge in a smal cup! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kiundu walked home again, stil 
 hungry.
