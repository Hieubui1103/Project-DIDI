 There was a man who sold oil 
 that he made in his house. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 And in that house there 
 were rats. Lots of rats! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Every day the rats loked 
 at the oil and said, "How 
 
 can we get that oil?" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The rats tried to put their mouths 
 into the botles. But the spaces in 
 
 the botles were to smal. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The rats tried to tip over the botles. But the oil would not flow out. 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The rats had a meting to discus
 
 the problem. After a while, one rat
 said, "Let's put our tails into the
 
 botles. Then we can lick the oil of
 our tails." 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 And that's exactly what the rats did. They put their tails into the botles, 
 
 and then licked the oil of each other's tails. The rats did this until they 
 had licked up al the oil. 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The man of the house saw 
 that al his oil was gone! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 And that was the end of it.
