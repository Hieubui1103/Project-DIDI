 Adun was very beautiful. Al the men 
 in her vilage wanted to mary her. 
 
 But Adun refused them al. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One market day, a man borowed 
 legs from another man, and arms 
 
 from another, and a body from a 
 
 third man. 
 
 
 Then this man joined al the parts
 together. He put his head on top and
 
 went to the market. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This man wanted Adun and was 
 
 determined to mary her. Adun was 
 
 pleased by his apearance. She 
 wanted to be with him. The man 
 
 came from a far town, and Adun 
 decided to return with him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As Adun and the man journeyed to
 
 his place, the owner of the legs tok
 the legs back. 
 
 
 Then the owner of the arms tok his
 
 arms back. 
 
 
 And finaly the owner of the body
 
 tok that back. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Only the head was left, and the head 
 
 went on. Adun was scared but she 
 did not run away. They arived at the 
 
 house of the head. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The folowing morning, before the
 
 head went to his farm, he spoke to
 Tortoise. “If Adun tries to escape,
 
 blow this horn to tel me,” said the
 head. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 After the head left, Adun packed her 
 things. Then she began to run away. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Seing her, Tortoise blew the horn,
 “Head, head, Adun is about to run
 
 away,” pufed Tortoise. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The head went up to Adun and said, 
 
 “Where do you think you are going?” 
 
 
 Adun went back to the head’s house. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Eventualy Adun consulted a diviner
 
 about what to do. The diviner 
 advised, “Go and buy some bean 
 
 cakes. Soak them in palm oil and
 put them in Tortoise’s horn.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Adun folowed the diviner’s 
 instructions. She put the oily cakes 
 
 into the horn. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The folowing day, she tok her 
 
 things and began to run away again.
 When Tortoise tok the horn to blow
 
 it, the delicious bean cakes fel into
 his mouth. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Tortoise ate, ate and ate. 
 And Adun ran away.
