 Mother was finishing packing her 
 clothes in a smal bag. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As she went out the dor, she 
 huged me and said, “Bye for now.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Where are you going, mum?” I 
 loked up at her as I asked. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I started to cry wanting to folow her
 but dad lifted me up on his shoulder.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Dad said, “Your mother is going to 
 
 the hospital to have a baby.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When I heard “baby” I stoped crying 
 
 and loked at him. 
 “Why is she going to get the baby 
 
 from the hospital?” I asked him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Dad sat me on a smal chair and 
 said, “I wil tel you why she is going
 
 to get the baby from the hospital.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I listened kenly to him as he explained although I didn’t quite 
 
 understand why she wasn’t having the baby at home. 
 When dad finished explaining, I asked, “Wil she stil love me when 
 
 she comes back with the other baby?” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 My dad held me close and said, “We
 wil always love you.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Can I write a leter to her while she 
 is there?” I asked dad. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 That evening, I began to write a 
 leter to mum. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I tore a paper from my exercise bok
 
 and began to write… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Mumy, mumy, dad said that you 
 have gone to bring another baby… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 …Please hury up and return home… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 …I want you to bring a baby girl, so I
 can play with her when she grows
 
 up… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 …You can bring two so one can be 
 mine… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 16  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 …I am waiting for you here outside
 our house.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 17  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I folded my leter so I could give it to 
 
 my father to bring it to mum. 
 
 
 When I woke up the folowing 
 morning, the leter was gone.
