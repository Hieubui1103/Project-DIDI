 Long time ago, in the vilage of
 
 Elunyiko, there lived a man caled
 Ndong’a and his wife caled 
 
 Namukhaywa. They had six children.
 Al of them were girls. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Namukhaywa was pregnant 
 
 with her seventh child, Ndong’a 
 
 warned her, “If you give birth to 
 another girl, I wil leave you. But if 
 
 you give me a baby boy, I wil hold a 
 big party for you!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When it was time to give birth, 
 
 Namukhaywa went to the traditional
 midwife. Would the child be a girl or
 
 a boy? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 It was a boy AND a girl – twins! She 
 caled the boy Mukhwana, and the 
 
 girl she caled Mulongo. 
 
 As she loked at Mukhwana, she 
 was very hapy. But as she loked 
 
 at Mulongo, she felt sad. She felt 
 that there was only one thing she 
 
 could do. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Namukhaywa left Mulongo in the 
 care of the midwife and tok 
 
 Mukhwana home to her husband. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She proudly showed Ndong’a the 
 
 baby boy. He was very hapy and 
 caled al the vilagers to celebrate 
 
 the birth of his son. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Mukhwana grew up to be a fine 
 young man. And Mulongo grew up 
 
 to be a fine young woman. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One day, while minding his father’s 
 
 catle, Mukhwana saw a very 
 beautiful girl. 
 
 “This is the girl I want to mary,” he 
 said to himself. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But when he asked her to mary him,
 
 she sang this song: 
 “Mukhwana wefwe, Mukhwana. 
 
 So yakhupa omunwa, Mukhwana. 
 
 Nebebula omukhana, Mukhwana. 
 Barulaka khulwanda, Mukhwana. 
 
 Nebebula omusiani, Mukhwana. 
 Barera mungo muno, Mukhwana. 
 
 Iyeyi yakwa, Mukhwana. 
 Iyindi yakwa, Mukhwana.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This hapened again and again. 
 Mukhwana did not know what to do. 
 
 So he went to his mother, 
 
 Namukhaywa. 
 “I have found a beautiful girl,” he 
 
 said. “And I want to mary her. But 
 every time I ask her, she sings the 
 
 same song.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 To his surprise, Namukhaywa said,
 “What the girl is singing about is
 
 true. That is your sister. You were
 born twins. Your father wanted a
 
 son, not a daughter. So I left your
 baby sister with the midwife, and
 
 brought you home to your father.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Mukhwana told his father the 
 
 story, he saw that he had ben 
 wrong. He caled Namukhaywa and 
 
 together they went to the midwife to 
 fetch Mulongo. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Mulongo arived home, her 
 
 father and the vilage elders 
 
 slaughtered a goat and performed
 the traditional ceremony for 
 
 re-uniting Mulongo and her seven
 siblings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A year later, Mulongo was maried to 
 
 the son of the rich king of that 
 vilage. She brought a lot of wealth 
 
 and hapines to her family.
