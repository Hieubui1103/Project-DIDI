 Long time ago, no animal had legs. 
 
 
 They al used to crawl on the 
 
 ground. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Only human beings had legs 
 because Maguru had given legs to
 
 humans. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One day, Maguru decided to 
 give legs to every animal. 
 
 
 
 He walked round the vilage 
 anouncing from a loudspeaker. 
 
 
 He wanted each animal to walk like 
 
 a human being. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The animals were hapy when they
 heard that they would be given legs.
 
 
 
 Each animal wanted to have legs so
 that it could walk and run. 
 
 
 They sang, waged their tails and
 
 flaped their wings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Animals gathered and discused 
 how dificult it was to crawl. 
 
 
 The ground scratched their belies. 
 
 
 Legs would also help them to stand 
 
 and se far, like human beings did. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When the day came, many animals 
 crawled to Maguru’s house to get
 
 their legs. 
 
 
 Girafes, lions, elephants, rabits,
 
 crocodiles, and birds queued and
 waited to be given 
 
 legs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Each animal was given four legs. 
 
 
 Birds were given two legs each. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Animals loked diferent on legs.
 
 
 
 Some danced in joy. 
 
 
 Others had dificulty walking and fel
 down. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 They walked round the vilage 
 
 showing of to human beings. 
 
 
 Al the animals said, “We wil never 
 crawl again.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The last animal in the queue was the
 milipede. 
 
 
 
 Maguru asked, “Is there anyone else
 after you?” 
 
 
 “No, I am the last one,” Milipede
 
 answered. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Maguru thought, “If there is no one 
 
 else, what wil I do with the rest of 
 
 the legs?” 
 
 
 Maguru gave al the remaining legs 
 to Milipede. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Milipede went away very hapy 
 
 because he had many legs. 
 
 
 “I wil move faster than any of them,”
 he thought. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As son as Milipede had left, the 
 
 snake came to Maguru’s house. 
 
 
 “Maguru, please give me some legs,” 
 Snake beged. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “I have given out al the legs. Where
 
 were you?” Maguru asked. 
 
 
 “I over-slept,” Snake replied. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Maguru checked in his house to se 
 
 whether there were any legs 
 remaining. 
 
 
 But he did not find any. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Maguru came out and said, “Sory,
 Snake, there are no legs remaining.”
 
 
 Snake had to crawl back home 
 
 without legs. 
 
 
 Since that day Snake does not slep
 much. 
 
 
 
 He is always waiting for the next
 chance to get legs.
