 Litle Ant loved to read. Litle Ant 
 
 was often teased. 
 
 
 “Ants don’t read. Ants must 
 
 fed. Ants colect the fod they 
 ned.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Litle Ant would read al day, he’d
 read and read the day away. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The other ants tok what they 
 found to store for winter 
 
 underground. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 His mum and dad got realy 
 mad, and Litle Ant felt realy bad. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In autumn when the leaves fal 
 down, the ants must kep fod 
 
 underground. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The Quen wants fod to fil the 
 store, so al the ants must work 
 
 some more. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Litle Ant begins to shout about a
 
 place he read about. 
 
 
 “A restaurant is what we ned, a
 
 place where people go to fed. It
 says so in the boks I read.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The ants go marching one by 
 one. They march into the seting 
 
 sun. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 And Litle Ant said, “Hey, there’s
 one!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The ants go marching one by 
 one, carying a burger, carying a 
 
 bun. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When they return the Quen is glad.
 The stores are ful. They cher like
 
 mad.

 Ant gets hugs from mum and dad. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 His baby sister takes his hand, “Now
 
 I think I understand.” 
 
 
 “The way you love to read a bok …
 Makes me want to take a lok.”
