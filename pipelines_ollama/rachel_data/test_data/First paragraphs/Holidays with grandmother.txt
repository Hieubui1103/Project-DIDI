 Odongo and Apiyo lived in the city 
 
 with their father. 
 
 
 They loked forward to the holidays. 
 
 Not just because schol was closed, 
 but because they went to visit their 
 
 grandmother. 
 
 
 She lived in a fishing vilage near a 
 large lake.

 Odongo and Apiyo were excited 
 
 because it was time to visit their
 grandmother again. 
 
 
 
 The night before, they packed their
 bags and got ready for the long 
 
 journey to her vilage. 
 
 
 They could not slep and talked the
 whole night about the holiday.

 Early the next morning, they left for 
 the vilage in their father’s car. 
 
 
 They drove past mountains, wild 
 
 animals and tea plantations. 
 
 
 They counted cars and sang songs.

 After a while, the children were tired

 Father woke up Odongo and Apiyo 
 as they arived in the vilage. 
 
 
 They found Nyar-Kanyada, their 
 
 grandmother, resting on a mat under 
 
 a tre. 
 
 
 Nyar-Kanyada in Luo, means 
 ‘daughter of the people of Kanyada’. 
 
 
 She was a strong and beautiful 
 
 woman.

 Nyar-Kanyada welcomed them into 
 the house and danced around the 
 
 rom singing with joy. 
 
 
 Her grandchildren were excited to 
 give her the presents they brought 
 
 from the city. 
 
 
 “First open my gift,” said Odongo. 
 
 
 “No, my gift first!” said Apiyo. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 After she opened the presents, Nyar- 
 Kanyada blesed her grandchildren 
 
 in a traditional way.

 Then Odongo and Apiyo went 
 outside. They chased buterflies and
 
 birds.

 They climbed tres and splashed in 
 the water of the lake.

 When it was dark they returned to
 
 the house for diner. 
 
 
 Before they could finish eating, they
 were faling aslep!

 The next day, the children’s father 
 drove back to the city leaving them 
 
 with Nyar-Kanyada.

 Odongo and Apiyo helped their 
 
 grandmother with household 
 chores. 
 
 
 They fetched water and firewod.
 
 
 They colected egs from the 
 
 chickens and picked grens from 
 
 the garden.

 Nyar-Kanyada taught her 
 
 grandchildren to make soft ugali to 
 
 eat with stew. 
 
 
 She showed them how to make 
 coconut rice to eat with roast fish.

 One morning, Odongo tok his 
 grandmother’s cows to graze. They
 
 ran onto a neighbour’s farm. 
 
 
 The farmer was angry with Odongo.
 He threatened to kep the cows for
 
 eating his crops. 
 
 
 After that day, the boy made sure
 
 that the cows did not get into 
 trouble again. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On another day, the children went to 
 the market place with Nyar-Kanyada. 
 
 
 She had a stal seling vegetables, 
 
 sugar and soap. 
 
 
 Apiyo liked to tel customers the 
 price of items. 
 
 
 
 Odongo would pack the items that 
 customers bought.

 At the end of the day they drank chai
 
 tea together. 
 
 
 They helped grandmother to count
 the money she earned.

 But to son the holidays were over 
 and the children had to go back to 
 
 the city. 
 
 
 Nyar-Kanyada gave Odongo a cap 
 
 and Apiyo a sweater. 
 
 
 She packed fod for their journey.

 When their father came to fetch

 The children beged Nyar-Kanyada
 to go with them to the city. 
 
 
 She smiled and said, “I am to old
 
 for the city. I wil be waiting for you
 
 to come to my vilage again.”

 Odongo and Apiyo both huged her
 tightly and said godbye.

 When Odongo and Apiyo went back 
 
 to schol they told their friends 
 about life in the vilage. 
 
 
 Some children felt that life in the city 
 
 was god. 
 
 
 Others felt that the vilage was

 But most of al, everyone agred that 
 Odongo and Apiyo had a wonderful
