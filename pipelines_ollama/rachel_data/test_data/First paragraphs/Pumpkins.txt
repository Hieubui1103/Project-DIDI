 Once upon a time there was a family
 with twelve children. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In the spring, the man planted some 
 seds in their garden. He said to his 
 
 family, “I found these seds and I 
 
 don’t know which plant they are 
 from.” 
 
 
 He warned them, “Don’t eat the fruit 
 
 until we know what it is.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The seds quickly grew into plants.
 
 The plants loked like pumpkin 
 plants. Son the round ripe fruit
 
 were ready for harvesting. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Just at this time, the father went 
 
 away from his family, to work. 
 
 
 The mother went to the market to 
 lok for fod for her children. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The children were so hungry that
 
 they couldn’t wait for their mother to
 return. The eldest child said, “Lok,
 
 I’m sure those are pumpkins, let’s
 pick some!” 
 
 
 So they picked the plants. They 
 
 coked them, and ate until they were
 
 ful. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Al the children fel down, dead! 
 
 
 When their mother came home, she 
 
 found her children lying lifeles. She 
 saw the pumpkin skins on a plate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She caled a dove and asked it to fly
 to her husband. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When the dove reached the place 
 
 where the man worked, it sang this 
 song to him: 
 
 
 Tsi tsi etsia mumbo 
 
 Tsio khulola Ondieki, tsi tsi 
 Maondo ki yaraka, tsi tsi 
 
 Kamalira abana, tsi tsi 
 
 Ekhumi na babili, tsi tsi 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The man was woried when he 
 
 heard the dove’s song. He started
 the journey home and went as fast
 
 as he could. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On the way he stoped to ask the 
 
 advice of a healer. 
 
 
 The healer listened to the father’s 
 
 story, and then gave him a magic 
 stick. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When the man arived home, he 
 
 touched each child with the magic
 stick. The children slowly came alive
 
 again. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 After that day, the children never 
 again ate pumpkins.
