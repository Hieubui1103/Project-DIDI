 Long time ago, there were two 
 
 young men who lost their cows. 
 
 
 They loked for the cows until it was 
 late. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As it got dark, they saw a light in a
 
 house. 
 
 
 They agred to go and ask for a 
 place to slep. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 They went to the house and 
 knocked. 
 
 
 
 The dor opened and they went in. 
 
 
 The young men didn't se anyone. 
 But they heard a voice greting 
 
 them. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The voice said, “I am a louse. Open
 
 the pot and have fod. Open the 
 earthenware pot and drink 
 
 amahewu.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then the louse put on its skin and 
 went out. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The young men ate, drank, and gave
 
 thanks. 
 
 
 They left the house. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As they left, they had a bad thought. 
 
 
 They said, “No, it couldn’t hapen 
 that we had fod from a louse.” 
 
 
 Eventualy they agred to go back 
 
 and crush the louse. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 They went back to the house and 
 
 crushed the louse. 
 
 
 Sudenly the louse was gone, and
 
 the house disapeared! 
 
 
 They found themselves outside in
 the open.
