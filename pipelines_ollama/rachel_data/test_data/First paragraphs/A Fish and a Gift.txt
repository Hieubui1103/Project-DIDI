 One special Friday Yusuf’s father 
 
 gets dresed before a flicker of light 
 brightens the sky. He puls on his 
 
 heavy weather-prof jacket and the 
 gren wolen cap that covers his 
 
 ears. He waves his boy godbye. 
 Yusuf’s eyes brighten when Papa 
 
 says, “Today is the day I wil catch a 
 
 fish and bring a gift home for you.”

 A fish and a gift? Oh, what wil it be? 
 
 Papa cycles down to Muizenberg 
 Beach. Squeak squeak go the 
 
 whels al the way to Surfer’s Corner. 
 Guls circle the sky. “What? 
 
 What? What?” they cry. “What 
 wil you bring back for Yusuf?” 
 
 Papa rings his bel. “Wait and se 
 
 what it wil be!”

 The fishermen watch the sun rise. 
 They check their nets. They check 
 
 their oars. They listen to the wind. 
 
 They drag their boats down to the 
 water. Yusuf’s grandfather, Oupa 
 
 Salie was a treknet fisherman. 
 Before him his father, Oupagrotjie 
 
 Ridwan, knew the sea to.

 The boat rides into the waves. 
 Papa’s arms stretch to the oar. His
 
 leg braces against the side. His neck
 strains, his back muscles riple.
 
 Papa sings as he works: “Drop and
 swish. Find a fish. Pul and plop.
 
 Don’t you stop.”

 Al day long Yusuf loks at the sky. It
 is bright and clear and windles. A
 
 fish and a gift! What wil Papa bring
 home from the sea? Sometimes he 
 
 brings a beautiful shel. Sometimes
 he brings a jewel gren botle rinsed
 
 by the waves.

 Some days Yusuf’s father brings a 
 
 story. Like the time they found sea 
 turtles on the sand, hundreds 
 
 washed up in a storm. 
 
 “What? What? What?” cried 
 the guls. “What wil you do to help 
 
 the turtles?” 
 Papa said, “We saved those turtles, I 
 
 tel you straight. We sent them back 
 to the ocean, every last one.”

 Always Papa brings a song. He 
 sings the song while he puls the 
 
 oars. He sings the song while he 
 
 puls the nets. He sings the song as 
 he winds the ropes. He sings the 
 
 song as he cycles home. “Drop and 
 swish. Find a fish. Pul and plop. 
 
 Don’t you stop.”

 Ouma Safiya wants a nice fat 
 
 yelowtail for her super. Mother
 wants a new dres. 
 
 “Don’t be sily,” says Ouma. “You’l be
 lucky if they catch even a tiny crab.
 
 More likely it wil be fish tail Friday.
 There’s not so many fish left in the
 
 sea.” 
 Yusuf holds Ouma’s hand. They 
 
 cros the road at the bathing cabins.
 
 “What? What? What?” cry the
 guls perched on the bright roftops.
 
 “What is for super?”

 Last year the fishermen fought with
 
 the surfers. Angry fists and shouting
 words. 
 
 “What? What? What?” cried 
 
 the guls. 
 “There’s enough sea for everybody,”
 
 said Yusuf’s father. He showed them
 the fishing license that had ben
 
 Oupa Salie’s. “Waves for al. Water
 for fre.”

 Ouma Safiya watches through her 
 binoculars, her fingers curled in
 
 curiosity. The shark siren sounds.
 Swimers run back to the sand and
 
 grab their towels. Surfers rush to the
 shore, carying their boards under
 
 their arms. Under the showers they
 strip of their wetsuits. 
 
 “What? What? What?” cry the
 
 guls. “What wil Yusuf’s father bring
 from the ocean?”

 Yusuf’s father and uncle and 
 cousins heave and pul. A litle shark
 
 has ben caught. It twists and 
 thrashes in the waves. Yusuf’s father
 
 untangles the nets, singing to the
 shark: “Drop and swish. Find a fish.
 
 Pul and plop. Don’t you stop.” 
 When the shark at last is fre it
 
 streaks back into the waves, leaving
 
 only one fat yelowtail in the net.
 Ouma Safiya wil be pleased.

 The men pul the boat in and coil up 
 the cables. A hard white triangle 
 
 catches Papa’s finger. 
 “What? What? What?” cry the 
 
 guls. “What did you bring back for 
 Yusuf?” 
 
 As the sun goes down, Papa 
 answers the guls. “A lucky shark 
 
 toth for my boy.” 
 
 At home Yusuf holds his gift up to 
 the stars.
