 Long time ago, in a Turkana vilage,
 
 people loved to dance the edonga
 dance. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Every evening they gathered 
 
 together and danced edonga. 
 The whole region came to know of 
 
 this vilage and its dancers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 People from the nearby vilages also
 came to dance edonga. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A stranger heard of the famous 
 vilage. He sent his mesenger 
 
 to go there before him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When the mesenger arived, the 
 vilagers were afraid. They wondered
 
 who the stranger was, and why he
 
 had sent his mesenger. 
 
 
 The vilagers prepared fod and 
 animals to be slaughtered. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The vilagers gathered and prepared 
 
 sacrifices. They sat the whole day 
 until evening. But the stranger did 
 
 not arive. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In the evening, the vilagers danced
 
 as usual until midnight. 
 
 
 That night there were many dancers.
 Everybody in the vilage was excited.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Before the dance ended, the 
 
 stranger arived. Even though he 
 was a stranger, he loked just like 
 
 the other vilagers. They did not 
 notice him at first. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When it was the stranger's turn to
 
 dance, he joined the men. But his
 dancing was strange and diferent
 
 from the others. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 People were amused and began to 
 
 laugh at the stranger. 
 
 
 Some dancers fel down laughing. 
 
 Some sat down, and others knelt 
 laughing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The stranger did not like people
 laughing at him. He decided to curse
 
 them. 
 
 
 He stoped dancing and everyone 
 became a stone in the position they
 
 were in. Some were lying down, 
 others standing, others siting and
 
 kneling. 
 
 
 Then the stranger left the vilage.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Since then, those stones remained there. At night they can be heard 
 
 singing and dancing edonga. 
 
 
 That is how we have the site of Namoratunga.
