 My vilage had many problems. 
 
 
 We made a long line to fetch water
 
 from one tap. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We waited under one big tre for 
 fod donated by others. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We locked our houses early because
 of theft. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Many children droped out of 
 schol. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Young girls worked as maids in 
 other vilages. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Young boys roamed around the 
 vilage while others worked on 
 
 people's farms. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When the wind blew, waste paper 
 hung on tres and fences. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 People were cut by broken glas 
 that was thrown carelesly. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then one day, the tap dried up and 
 our containers were empty. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 My father walked from house to 
 house caling people to atend a
 
 vilage meting. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 People gathered under the big tre 
 where we had got donated fod. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 My father stod in the midle of the
 
 group. 
 
 He said, “We ned to solve the 
 problems in 
 
 our vilage. We ned to work 
 together.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Eight-year-old Juma, siting on a tre 
 trunk shouted, “I can help with 
 
 cleaning up.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One midle-aged woman said, “The
 women can join me to grow fod.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Another man stod up and said, 
 “The men wil dig a wel for water.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 We al shouted with one voice, “We
 
 must change our lives.” 
 
 
 From that day we worked together
 and solved our problems.
