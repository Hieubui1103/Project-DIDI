 Once upon a time al the animals
 
 lived together in the bush. 
 
 
 The roster was their chief. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Roster told the animals that the 
 
 comb on his head was made of fire. 
 
 
 For this reason al the animals 
 feared the roster. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In those days, fire was made using a
 
 bow dril. 
 
 
 One rainy day, Leopard’s bow dril
 
 got wet. She could not make a fire to
 warm her family. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 So Leopard sent her cubs to ask 
 Roster for fire from his comb. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Roster was in a bad mod. He sent
 
 the cubs away without any fire. 
 
 
 Leopard was upset when the cubs 
 came back with nothing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Late that night when Roster was 
 
 aslep, Leopard and cubs went to 
 
 steal the fire from Roster’s comb. 
 
 
 Leopard picked some dry gras 
 outside Roster’s house. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She put the dry gras next to the
 
 sleping Roster’s comb. But the
 
 gras did not catch fire. 
 
 
 She carefuly touched the comb. It
 was cold! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The cubs also touched the comb. 
 
 There was no fire! 
 
 
 The leopard family al started 
 laughing. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The leopards’ laughter woke Roster
 
 and the chickens. 
 
 
 Roster turned his comb towards 
 
 them, shouting, “You should run 
 away. Aren’t you afraid?” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Leopard replied, “We touched your 
 
 comb and we know about your trick! 
 We’l go back and tel the other 
 
 animals. They wil be angry with 
 you.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The chickens were afraid. They ran
 
 away and Roster ran with them. 
 
 
 The chickens left the bush and went
 to live with people. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Since that time, chickens have 
 feared leopards and lived with 
 
 people for protection.
