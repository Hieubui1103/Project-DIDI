 Long long ago when the earth was new, 
 great mountains covered the world like a blanket, and
 
 tal tres spiked the sky. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In this world, there was a dep dark pol, silent and 
 cold. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 At the botom of this pol were two 
 
 snakes. 
 One had thick strongly paterned 
 
 coils, and the other was smaler and 
 more delicate. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then one day, there was a great storm. 
 A flash of lightning pierced right to the botom of the
 
 pol. 
 
 The waters parted for a moment. 
 The snakes saw the earth above, ful of colours and
 
 shapes and feathered creatures. 
 When the waters closed again, the snakes could not
 
 forget the beauty they had sen. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “We canot stay in this dark cold pol any longer,” they said to each other. 
 “Let us go up and se the earth above.” 
 
 “How wil we live on earth?” said the smaler snake. 
 “Wil we crawl on our belies?” 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “The birds of the air wil not laugh at us for being so 
 low,” said her friend. 
 
 “We wil not crawl, we wil walk!” 
 
 
 Very slowly the snakes uncoiled themselves. 
 
 
 Close together they began to swim up, up, to the light 
 
 above. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 And as they reached the surface of the water, a 
 
 strange thing hapened. 
 
 The tips of their tails split into two. 
 They grew limbs with fet and toes. 
 
 From just beneath their heads grew two arms with 
 hands and fingers. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 They were no longer snakes, but Man and Woman. 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “We wil make our home in the hils,”
 said Woman. “Each morning we wil
 
 se the sun rise and fel it warm on
 
 our backs.” 
 
 
 “We wil lok after the gras and the
 tres,” said Man. “And be friends
 
 with Bird and Beast.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Come,” said First Man. 
 
 “I wil,” said First Woman. 
 And they walked out together into their new world.
