 Once upon a time, there lived two sisters, Nelima and
 
 Nambuya. 
 
 
 Their parents were dead. They lived on bare land.
 
 
 There was neither rain nor crops to eat. 
 
 
 Whoever wanted fod had to go a long distance to
 
 find any. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Nelima was a humble, quiet and 
 helpful girl. 
 
 
 Her sister Nambuya was proud and 
 
 did not listen to advice. 
 
 
 She did not care about other people. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One day, the two sisters woke up
 and found that they had nothing to
 
 eat. 
 
 
 They had to lok for fod. 
 
 
 So Nelima and Nambuya went of in
 
 diferent directions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Meanwhile, there lived an old 
 woman caled Netasile. 
 
 
 
 She was believed to be a giver of
 riches. 
 
 
 Netasile had leprosy and her body
 
 was ful of sores. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Nambuya came acros this old 
 
 woman, who caled her, 
 “My daughter, how are you? Where 
 
 do you come from? Where are you 
 going?” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Nambuya answered al the 
 questions. 
 
 
 
 Then the old woman said, “Come 
 cary me to my house and I wil tel
 
 you what to do.” 
 
 
 Nambuya was rude to the woman. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She said, “I would rather die than 
 touch those dirty sores of yours.” 
 
 
 The old woman kept quiet and 
 
 wished her a safe journey. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Nambuya walked until she reached a
 
 place where there were milipedes,
 snakes, caterpilars and many other
 
 insects. 
 
 
 She was very tired and weak 
 
 because she had not eaten anything.
 
 
 When she sat down to rest, these
 creatures began to bite her. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On her journey, Nelima came to the
 
 same woman. 
 
 
 She was hapy to se Netasile, 
 being the first person she met since
 
 starting her journey. 
 
 
 The old woman caled her and asked
 
 the same questions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Nelima agred to cary Netasile to 
 
 her house. 
 
 
 “You have done what many have 
 failed to do,” said the old woman. 
 
 
 She gave Nelima a stick and told her 
 
 to go back home, where she would 
 
 find everything she wanted. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Nelima was very grateful and 
 
 thanked the old woman. 
 
 
 She ran back home and found a new 
 house with everything in it, and a lot 
 
 of fod. 
 
 
 She became the richest woman in 
 
 the land. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But she mourned for the los of her 
 
 sister. 
 
 
 She said, “One who did not listen to 
 
 advice ended up in an elephant’s 
 mouth.”
