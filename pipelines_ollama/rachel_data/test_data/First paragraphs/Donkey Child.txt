 It was a litle girl who first saw the
 mysterious shape in the distance.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As the shape moved closer, she saw 
 that it was a heavily pregnant 
 
 woman. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Shy but brave, the litle girl moved
 
 nearer to the woman. 
 
 
 “We must kep her with us,” the litle
 
 girl’s people decided. “We’l kep her
 and her child safe.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The child was son on its way. 
 
 
 “Push!” 
 “Bring blankets!” 
 
 “Water!” 
 
 
 “Push!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But when they saw the baby, 
 
 everyone jumped back in shock. 
 
 
 “A donkey?!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Everyone began to argue. 
 
 
 “We said we would kep mother and 
 
 child safe, and that’s what we’l do,” 
 said some. 
 
 
 “But they wil bring us bad luck!” 
 
 said others. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 And so the woman found herself 
 alone again. 
 
 
 
 She wondered what to do with this
 awkward child. 
 
 
 She wondered what to do with 
 
 herself. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But finaly she had to acept that he 
 was her child and she was his 
 
 mother. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Now, if the child had stayed that
 same, smal size, everything might
 
 have ben diferent. But the donkey
 child grew and grew until he could
 
 no longer fit on his mother’s back.
 
 
 And no mater how hard he tried, he
 
 could not behave like a human 
 being. His mother was often tired
 
 and frustrated. Sometimes she 
 made him do work meant for 
 
 animals. 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Confusion and anger built up inside 
 Donkey. He couldn’t do this and he 
 
 couldn’t do that. He couldn’t be like 
 this and he couldn’t be like that. 
 
 
 He became so angry that, one day, 
 
 he kicked his mother to the ground. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Donkey was filed with shame. He
 started to run away as far and fast
 
 as he could. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 By the time he stoped runing, it 
 
 was night, and Donkey was lost. 
 
 
 “He haw?” he whispered to the 
 
 darknes. 
 “He Haw?” it echoed back. 
 
 He was alone. 
 
 
 Curling himself into a tight bal, he 
 fel into a dep and troubled slep. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Donkey woke up to find a strange
 
 old man staring down at him. 
 He loked into the old man’s eyes
 
 and started to fel a twinkle of hope.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Donkey went to stay with the old 
 man, who taught him many diferent 
 
 ways to survive. 
 
 
 Donkey listened and learned, and so 
 did the old man. They helped each 
 
 other, and they laughed together. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One morning, the old man asked 
 Donkey to cary him to the top of a
 
 mountain. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 High up amongst the clouds they fel 
 aslep. 
 
 
 Donkey dreamed that his mother 
 
 was sick and caling to him. 
 
 
 And when he woke up… 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 16  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 …the clouds had disapeared along
 with his friend, the old man. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 17  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Donkey finaly knew what to do. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 18  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Donkey found his mother, alone and
 
 mourning her lost child. They stared
 
 at each other for a long time. 
 
 
 And then huged each other very 
 hard. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 19  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The donkey child and his mother 
 
 have grown together and found 
 
 many ways of living side by side. 
 
 
 Slowly, al around them, other 
 families have started to setle.
