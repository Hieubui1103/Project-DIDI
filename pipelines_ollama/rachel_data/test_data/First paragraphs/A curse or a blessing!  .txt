 It has ben raining for thre days. 
 There is water everywhere. 
 
 
 There is a problem. 
 
 
 The only bridge linking Napetet vilage with the 
 
 shoping centre has ben caried away by water.

 To make it worse many houses have ben washed 
 
 away by flods. 
 
 
 Only permanent houses remain standing.

 We had waited for the rains! 
 
 
 What semed a blesing in the begining is now a disaster for 
 
 vilagers. 
 
 
 Everybody had prepared their farm for the planting season. 
 
 
 Now, we canot even do that!

 Before this terible situation, Lomongin, the famous 
 
 rain-maker in the area, was sen consulting his gods. 
 
 
 People gathered outside his home anxiously waiting 
 for a mesage of hope. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When he come out of his house, he asured people
 
 that the creator was going to answer their prayers.
 
 
 That they wil have enough rain for their crops.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Children played outside as we waited for the rains.
 
 
 Later that day, we saw big white clouds in the far east.
 
 
 I knew they were rain clouds. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 People were stil thinking about what the rain maker said. 
 
 Mother shouted loudly, “There! The clouds are now dark.” 
 Sudenly, heavy rain poured. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Some people had left their homes and their farms 
 
 thinking that the rain would stop. 
 
 
 The rain tok many days. 
 
 
 Animals played in the gras. 
 
 
 People waited anxiously for the rain to stop but it 
 
 rained and rained. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 People of Napetet had longed for rain but now they
 
 did not want it any more. 
 
 
 Some had no homes. They had no bridge to cros on.
 
 
 Only few wanted more rain so their dams could fil up.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 People of Napetet vilage also had a 
 new problem! 
 
 
 
 They saw crocodiles swiming 
 everywhere. 
 
 
 This had never hapened before. 
 
 The vilagers were confused. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 They could not go for shoping as
 
 al the shops were acros the river.
 
 
 Children couldn't go to schol 
 because most schols were acros
 
 the river.

 There was gras everywhere. 
 
 
 Then, grashopers began eating leaves.

 What should have ben a blesing, was a big los to Napetet residents. 
 
 Lomongin, the rain-maker, was disapointed as wel! 
 
 
 The only person who was hapy was Kapus with his nine cats!
