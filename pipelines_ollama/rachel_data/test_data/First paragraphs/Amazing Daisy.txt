 Once upon a time on a litle farm 
 near a litle vilage 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 there lived a litle chicken 
 caled Daisy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “When I grow up, I want to fly high, 
 high into the sky,” Daisy said. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But al the other chickens 
 laughed at her. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “You are so weird,” they said. 
 “We won’t play with you anymore.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Daisy, we can al flap our wings but
 it’s very dificult for chickens to fly,”
 
 Mama told her. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Daisy wouldn’t give up. 
 
 
 Every day she practised by herself, 
 
 flaping her wings. 
 
 
 Flap, flap, flap, she would flap her 
 wings but she couldn’t lift of the 
 
 ground. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 While she practised, she imagined
 
 herself flying high into the sky and
 loking at the chickens below. 
 
 
 She imagined herself flying past the
 
 sparows and past the swalows. 
 
 
 “Wow!” the birds would say. 
 
 “A chicken that can fly!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 So … Flap, flap, flap, every day Daisy 
 would flap her wings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She would lift of the ground but fal
 down again. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “I’m never going to fly!” Daisy cried 
 to Mama. “The others are right.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Daisy, you are diferent from 
 
 the other chickens. They don’t want
 to fly but you do! You can do 
 
 it,” Mama said. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 The folowing day Daisy climbed 
 
 to the top of the chicken cop 
 and flap, flap, flap, she flaped her 
 
 wings. 
 
 
 She flew into the air and flaped her 
 wings … 
 
 
 and flaped her wings … 
 
 
 
 and flaped her wings 
 
 
 and … 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 BAM! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The other chickens laughed out 
 
 loud. 
 
 
 “Ha ha ha! We told you! 
 Chickens can’t fly!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But the next day Daisy climbed even
 
 higher, right up to the top of the
 
 rondavel. 
 
 
 Flap, flap, flap, Daisy flaped her
 wings. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 16  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She flew into the air and flaped her 
 wings … and flaped her wings 
 
 … and flaped her wings and … 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 17  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She kept flying! 
 
 
 The wind beneath her wings grew 
 
 stronger and she flew higher and
 higher! 
 
 
 The sparows and the swalows 
 
 said, “Amazing! A flying chicken!”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 18  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 And the other chickens wanted to be 
 
 just like her. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 19  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 They said, “Oh Daisy, you’re 
 amazing!”
