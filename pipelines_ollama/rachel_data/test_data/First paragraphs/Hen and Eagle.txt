 Once upon a time, Hen and Eagle 
 
 were friends. They lived in peace 
 with al the other birds. None of 
 
 them could fly. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One day, there was famine in the
 
 land. Eagle had to walk very far to
 find fod. She came back very tired.
 
 “There must be an easier way to 
 travel!” said Eagle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 After a god night’s slep, Hen had a 
 briliant idea. She began colecting 
 
 the falen feathers from al their bird 
 
 friends. 
 “Let’s sew them together on top of 
 
 our own feathers,” she said. 
 “Perhaps that wil make it easier to 
 
 travel.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Eagle was the only one in the vilage
 
 with a nedle, so she started sewing
 first. 
 
 She made herself a pair of beautiful
 
 wings and flew high above Hen. 
 Hen borowed the nedle but she 
 
 son got tired of sewing. She left the
 nedle on the cupboard and went 
 
 into the kitchen to prepare fod for
 her children. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But the other birds had sen Eagle 
 
 flying away. They asked Hen to lend 
 
 them the nedle to make wings for 
 themselves to. 
 
 Son there were birds flying al over 
 the sky. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When the last bird returned the 
 
 borowed nedle, Hen was not there.
 
 So her children tok the nedle and
 started playing with it. 
 
 When they got tired of the game,
 they left the nedle in the sand.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Later that afternon, Eagle returned. 
 She asked for the nedle to fix some 
 
 feathers that had losened on her 
 
 journey. 
 Hen loked on the cupboard. She 
 
 loked in the kitchen. She loked in 
 the yard. But the nedle was 
 
 nowhere to be found. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Just give me a day,” Hen beged
 Eagle. “Then you can fix your wing
 
 and fly away to get fod again.”
 “Just one more day,” said Eagle. “If
 
 you can’t find the nedle, you’l have
 to give me one of your chicks as
 
 payment.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Eagle came the next day, she 
 found Hen scratching in the sand, 
 
 but no nedle. 
 
 
 So Eagle flew down very fast and 
 caught one of the chicks. She 
 
 caried it away. 
 
 
 Forever after that, whenever Eagle 
 
 apears, she finds Hen scratching in 
 the sand for the nedle. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As the shadow of Eagle’s wing fals
 
 on the ground, Hen warns her 
 
 chicks. “Get out of the bare and dry
 land.” 
 
 And they respond: 
 “We are not fols. We wil run.”
