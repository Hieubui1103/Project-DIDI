 Once upon a time, there was an old
 woman who lived with her thre 
 
 grandchildren. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Every morning they al went to work 
 
 in the field. 
 
 
 But one day, one of the girls said, 
 
 “Grandmother, I don’t fel wel 
 today.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 So the old woman sent the child 
 home. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When the girl got home, she saw 
 
 that there was meat in the pot. She 
 ate al the meat and then went to 
 
 slep. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The old woman and two children 
 were tired and hungry when they 
 
 returned from the field. 
 
 
 Grandmother prepared ugali for 
 super, to eat with the meat she had
 
 coked early in the morning. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She opened the pots to serve her 
 grandchildren. When she opened the 
 
 pot with the meat, it was empty! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Who ate the meat?” asked 
 
 Grandmother, frowning. But al thre
 grandchildren shok their heads.
 
 
 “Not me,” each one said. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 So their grandmother tied a rope 
 
 acros the river. She told each of 
 them to walk on the rope as they 
 
 sang a song. 
 
 
 “The one that ate the meat wil fal 
 into the river, and learn to tel the 
 
 truth,” Grandmother said to the 
 
 children. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The first grandaughter walked 
 quickly acros the river, singing the
 
 song. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The song went like this: 
 
 
 
 Nimbe esia ulire inyama. 
 Mukoye khalira engwe mu nyanza. 
 
 Engwe mu ndaliro engwe munyanza. 
 Mukoye khalira engwe mu nyanza. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The other two grandchildren began 
 
 to argue with each other. The girl 
 said to the boy, “You go next.” The 
 
 boy replied, “No, you go next!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The grandaughter who ate the 
 
 meat was scared and shivering. As
 she steped forward to walk on the
 
 rope, she sliped and fel into the
 river. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Help! Help!” shouted the girl. 
 
 
 Grandmother said to the other two, 
 
 “She is guilty, but we must help her.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Together they puled the frightened
 
 girl out of the river. 
 
 
 Since that day, the old woman’s 
 
 grandchildren have always told the
 truth.
