 The people in a vilage of smal huts
 
 were becoming unhapy. 
 Wild animals began to come and 
 
 frighten them. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 These animals ate al their crops 
 
 and even caried children away. 
 It was not a god place to live any 
 
 longer, but where could the people 
 go? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One family found the answer. 
 It was not hard to find fod up in the
 
 hils. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Bushes grew in the cracks betwen 
 
 rocks. 
 Tres grew on the slopes of the hils. 
 
 The parents traped rock rabits 
 and the children caught birds. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Other families noticed how wel the
 
 hil family lived. 
 “It is a god life up in the hils,” said
 
 the husband. “You should come 
 there to.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Son the other families left the flat 
 
 land and went up to the hils. 
 Each family found a cave to live in, 
 
 and felt warm and secure. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Son the children became very quick
 
 at climbing rocks, and finding fruit in
 the tres. 
 
 They could swing in the branches
 almost as wel as any monkey. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Slowly, things began to change. The 
 
 children talked les, and grunted 
 more. Then the adults noticed that 
 
 their noses were geting biger and 
 that they were growing more hair. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Every time they loked at one 
 
 another they saw that their teth
 were longer. 
 
 They started to walk on four legs.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 They became a new creature that 
 
 no-one had sen before in that 
 place. This was the creature which 
 
 people now cal the babon. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 For a time, the babons lived 
 
 hapily. They stoped chasing the
 rock rabits and ate grubs from the
 
 ground. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 They forgot how to talk. They tok of their clothes because their 
 legs and arms were covered with dark hair. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 They stil remembered that they had 
 
 ben people. They loked at each 
 other’s big noses and laughed at 
 
 each other. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But they did not like the laughing.
 
 They jumped up and down in anger.
 
 Son the babons could not be 
 together because of the laughing
 
 and the anger. Each family went of
 and lived by itself. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14  
 
 
 
 
 That is why babons live in smal groups today and do not live as a babon nation.
