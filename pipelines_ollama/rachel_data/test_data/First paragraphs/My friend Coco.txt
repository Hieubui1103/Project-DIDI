 When I was five years old, my uncle
 
 gave me a wonderful present. 
 
 It was a thre-wek-old pupy! 
 The day my uncle brought the pupy
 
 home, I was very hapy. 
 I knew I had a friend. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 After puting him down, my uncle 
 turned to me and asked, “What 
 
 name wil you give him?” 
 I loked at my pupy, and said, 
 
 “Coco.” 
 My uncle was surprised. 
 
 He asked, “Why do you cal him 
 
 Coco?” 
 I said, “Because he loks like cocoa.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I asked my uncle if Coco was born alone. 
 
 My uncle said that there was another pupy, exactly
 like Coco. 
 
 I went to se Coco’s brother. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Coco saw his brother, he was 
 
 very excited. 
 The two of them put their heads 
 
 together as if they were talking. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I asked my uncle if I could kep both
 
 Coco and his brother. 
 
 “Al right,” he said. “But you must
 lok after them.” 
 
 So every evening, I played with them
 and tok them for exercise. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A few months later, Coco and his 
 
 brother were big, strong and healthy. 
 They were to big for me to lok 
 
 after on my own. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 So I asked my uncle to take back
 Coco’s brother. 
 
 
 
 But when Coco was left alone, he
 loked very sad. 
 
 
 It felt as if he was asking me, “Why
 
 did you do that?” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 He stoped playing. 
 Sometimes he refused to go for a 
 
 walk with me. 
 
 There were times when Coco ate 
 very litle. 
 
 I was woried. 
 I asked myself, “What can I do to 
 
 help Coco?” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then one day my uncle came to visit. 
 When I heard his voice, I rushed out of the house. 
 
 Before I could se him, I heard the barking of dogs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Behind the kitchen, dancing hapily 
 before me were Coco and his 
 
 brother! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 I was so hapy that I did not know
 
 who to hug first, Coco or my uncle.
 
 
 I knew Coco would go back to his
 old self now that his brother was
 
 back. 
 
 
 We would go runing in the fields
 
 again!
