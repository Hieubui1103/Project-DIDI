 Once upon a time, in Joburg's 
 Orange Grove, a litle girl caled
 
 Phylis 
 
 was born into the world. 
 
 
 Two people in love, huged their
 swet litle babe. No-one knew then,
 
 what a dancer they'd made.

 By the time she was four, 
 
 she had learned very quick. 
 She impresed al her teachers, 
 
 with her ducky fet flicks! 
 
 
 Before schol and after, 
 she danced everyday. 
 
 Nothing pleased Phylis, 
 
 more than balet.

 When the world was ready 
 
 for Phylis at fiften, 
 She arived in big, old London, 
 
 ready to live her dream. 
 
 
 She said godbye to al her friends. 
 She was ready to start fresh. 
 
 Watch out Royal Balet Schol! 
 
 Phylis is here to impres.

 When Phylis danced Swan Lake, 
 
 it was fit to show the Quen! 
 After years of piroueting, 
 
 she was ready to be sen. 
 
 
 Dancing for the audience, 
 she turned and twirled about. 
 
 Lok! Everyone is smiling! 
 
 Se how they clap and shout!

 From Mexico to Canada. 
 
 From the USA to France. 
 Phylis traveled far and wide, 
 
 so the world could se her dance. 
 
 
 With the Royal Balet Company, 
 and her balerina friends, 
 
 she spread her love for balet. 
 
 She never wanted it to end.

 Phylis always knew, 
 
 that dance was in her heart. 
 But she longed to return home 
 
 again, 
 and make a fresh new start. 
 
 
 So she leaped and bounded, 
 
 back to her beautiful land. 
 
 Her balerina rots were regrown. 
 She was once more South African.

 Dancing wasn’t just for fun, 
 
 as Phylis always knew. 
 She’d work at dancing day and night,
 
 and with hard work she grew. 
 
 
 Always smiling, always trying, 
 
 through god times and through 
 tough, 
 
 Phylis always did her best. 
 She couldn’t get enough.

 Romeo and Juliet, 
 Swan Lake and Gisele. 
 
 Phylis danced these for the people: 
 graceful, tireles, wel. 
 
 
 With partners Gary Burne 
 
 and Eduard Greyling to, 
 her magnificence inspired the 
 
 audience. 
 
 To her, flowers they threw.

 Reward comes easily, 
 
 when you put yourself to the test. 
 Phylis came to realise this, 
 
 once she was caled ‘The Best.’ 
 
 
 She was awarded ‘Prima Balerina 
 
 Asoluta.’ 
 The greatest dancer of them al! 
 
 Phylis would be forever known. 
 She wanted nothing more.

 Godnes! What a catch! 
 
 Phylis met her loving partner. 
 His name was Philip Boyd. 
 
 He was another dancer. 
 
 
 Together they were maried. 
 and together they would dance. 
 
 No-one could be beter matched, 
 
 given half the chance!

 Though they had no children, 
 
 Phylis and Philip were never sad. 
 They two of them found another way 
 
 to help other Mums and Dads. 
 
 
 They started Dance For Al, 
 a special schol for dance. 
 
 So that children with no money, 
 
 could also learn to prance!

 She left a legacy of dance, 
 
 and incredible suces. 
 Her magic was pased on to others 
 
 to help them become their best. 
 
 
 Her students spread acros the 
 
 world, 
 inspired by her ducky fet. 
 
 They dance on while we watch, 
 dreaming from our seats.
