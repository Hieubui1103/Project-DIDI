 A long time ago, in the vilage of 
 Mkosi, there lived a gredy hyena. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In a nearby vilage, lived a timid
 
 tortoise. 
 
 
 The hyena and the tortoise were 
 friends. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hyena heard that acros the great 
 
 western river lived bes that made 
 delicious honey. These bes traveled 
 
 once a year, and were away from 
 their hives for a whole wek. 
 
 
 “We must get that honey while the 
 
 bes are away,” said Hyena to 
 
 Tortoise. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The tortoise was afraid to go. But he 
 was to timid to refuse. 
 
 
 
 The next morning, the two animals 
 set of for the behives. 
 
 
 The hyena walked very fast but the 
 
 tortoise draged behind in fear. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 They went up a hil, down into a
 
 valey and acros the plains. Then
 they crosed the great western river,
 
 and walked further. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Finaly, they saw behives in tres on 
 
 a hil. The hyena ran to the tres 
 energeticaly. The tortoise almost 
 
 fainted because he was so tired and 
 hungry. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Hyena reached the bigest 
 
 behive, he wasted no time. He 
 caled to Tortoise, “Quickly, climb up
 
 the tre and knock down the hive.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The tortoise strugled slowly up the 
 
 tre. He knew he could easily slip 
 and fal. This anoyed the hyena, 
 
 who started yeling at Tortoise. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Tortoise touched the behive,
 he heard the buzing of bes. They
 
 were stil in their hives! 
 
 
 The tortoise was startled and fel
 out of the tre. The big behive fel
 
 to. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The behive landed on the tortoise. 
 
 Honey covered him completely so 
 
 he was hiden! 
 
 
 Hyena started to lick up the honey. 
 The bes were not pleased. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The bes stung the hyena on every
 
 part of his body. Hyena decided to
 run for his life but the bes folowed
 
 him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The hyena ran down the hil, through 
 
 the river, acros the plains and into 
 
 the valey. 
 
 
 The bes swarmed around him al 
 the way, stinging him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The tortoise, stil under the big
 
 behive, noticed that everything was
 quiet. The behive and honey had
 
 dried on his back. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Son the tortoise realised that he no 
 
 longer neded to crawl into a bush 
 to hide. His hard new shel of honey 
 
 could protect him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The hyena was so tired and ful of
 stings that he fainted before he got
 
 home. 
 
 
 When he woke up, he discovered 
 that the stings had caused patches
 
 in is fur. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This is how the tortoise got his hard shel, and the hyena got his 
 
 patches. 
 
 
 Hyena swore that he would never again steal. 
 
 
 But the hyena and the tortoise are no longer friends.
