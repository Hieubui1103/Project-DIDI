 Once upon a time, there was a 
 young man caled Pontshibobo. 
 
 
 When he was litle he was a very 
 
 god boy. He had grown into a very 
 god man. He respected everybody 
 
 he met. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pontsihibobo had a friend caled
 
 Hipo. He was not respectful like
 Pontshibobo. 
 
 
 
 One day Pontshibobo and Hipo 
 were walking down the stret 
 
 together. 
 
 
 Hipo had an idea, “Let’s go and
 smoke a zol,” he said. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pontshibobo was surprised. “Why 
 do you ask me to smoke with 
 
 you?You know that I don’t smoke.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hipo got cros. 
 
 
 “If you don’t want to smoke with me
 
 you can’t be my friend,” he said and
 walked of. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pontshibobo went home and sat 
 under the tre in his yard and cried. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Why are you crying?” asked the 
 
 tre. 
 
 
 Pontshibobo got a huge fright. He
 had never heard a tre talking 
 
 before. 
 
 
 He told the tre about Hipo. “I have
 
 lost a friend,” he said. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The tre asked Pontshibobo, “What 
 do you realy wish for?” 
 
 
 
 Pontshibobo thought for a while. 
 Then he replied, “I want a house. I 
 
 am grown up now and I want a 
 home. I want to mary and have 
 
 children.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The tre also thought for a while.
 
 “Take my leaves and my branches 
 and build yourself a house with 
 
 them,” he said. 
 
 
 Pontshibobo did as the tre told him
 and he built a smal, beautiful house.
 
 He maried and had children. He 
 
 was hapy. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But the tre was not hapy. 
 Pontshibobo had forgoten al about 
 
 him and he felt sad. 
 
 
 “I ned a friend,” the tre said to 
 himself, “or else I wil die.” 
 
 
 Just at that moment Pontshibobo 
 
 came into the yard. He heard what 
 
 the tre said, and he saw that the 
 tre was very sick. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pontshibobo was also sad. He had
 forgoten al about the tre that had
 
 helped him build a house for his wife
 and children. 
 
 
 “I am so sory,” he cried and gave the
 
 tre a big hug. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When the tre saw that his friend 
 was back he smiled. He grew new 
 
 branches and fresh leaves. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Pontshibobo’s children climbed up
 
 the branches of the tre. 
 
 
 Pontshibobo and his wife sat in the
 
 shade after a long day at work. They
 told stories and laughed and were
 
 hapy. 
 
 
 Pontshibobo and the tre were 
 friends forever.
