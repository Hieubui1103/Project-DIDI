 Long time ago there lived a girl 
 
 whose name was Kalabushe. 
 
 Kalabushe was a very talkative girl. 
 Kalabushe’s mother warned her not 
 
 to talk to much, but Kalabushe did 
 not listen. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One day, Kalabushe’s aunt fel sick.
 She lived acros the valey on the
 
 other side of Kalabushe’s vilage.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kalabushe’s mother was very busy
 
 that day. It was late in the evening by
 the time she gave Kalabushe fod to
 
 take to her sick aunt. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On the way Kalabushe met Sinson,
 the hyena who had changed into a
 
 person. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Sinson asked her what she was 
 
 carying. Kalabushe answered, 
 “Meat, egs and milk.” Kalabushe’s 
 
 mother had warned her not to say 
 what she was carying. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kalabushe also told Sinson that her
 
 aunt was sick and that she was 
 taking the fod to her. Sinson began
 
 salivating at the thought of the meat
 that Kalabushe was carying. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 He quickly ran ahead of Kalabushe 
 to her aunt’s house. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 He swalowed Kalabushe’s aunt and
 then covered himself with her 
 
 blanket. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Kalabushe arived, the house
 
 was very quiet. She went inside the
 house and caled out, “Aunt, where
 
 are you?” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When she did not hear her aunt’s 
 
 voice, Kalabushe went to the iner 
 rom where her aunt slept. She was 
 
 surprised when she saw someone 
 covered with a big blanket. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Aunt, why are your ears so big 
 
 today?” asked Kalabushe. 
 Sinson replied from under the big
 
 blanket, “So that I can hear you wel.”
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kalabushe asked again, “Aunt, why 
 
 are your eyes so big today?” 
 Sinson answered, “So I can se you 
 
 wel.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kalabushe finaly asked, “Aunt, why 
 
 is your mouth so big today?” 
 
 Sinson replied, “So I can swalow 
 you up.” 
 
 Sinson jumped from the bed and 
 swalowed up Kalabushe. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Because Kalabushe was very 
 
 talkative, she kept talking even when 
 she was inside Sinson’s stomach. 
 
 She asked many questions. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 14  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 In the end, Sinson was so tired of 
 Kalabushe’s many questions that he 
 
 decided to spit her out. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 15  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kalabushe and her aunt were 
 
 rescued by the vilagers. From that 
 day, Kalabushe did not talk to 
 
 much to strangers.
