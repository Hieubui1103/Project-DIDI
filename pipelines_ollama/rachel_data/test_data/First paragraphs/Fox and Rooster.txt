 There was a time when al the 
 
 animals lived together as friends. 
 
 
 One day they decided to have a 
 meting to elect a king. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Roster wanted to be king. So he 
 
 lied to the other animals. 
 
 
 He told them, “The red comb on my 
 
 head is fire! Don’t touch the comb on 
 my head!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The other animals believed Roster. 
 
 They decided to elect Roster as 
 
 their king. 
 
 
 The animals hoped that Roster’s 
 fire would help them in cold weather. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then came a day when it rained. 
 
 And rained. 
 And rained. 
 
 It was cold. 
 Everything was wet and cold. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Where can we get fire to warm our 
 bodies?” 
 
 Rabit asked the other animals. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “We can get fire from the comb on 
 
 Roster’s head,” replied Monkey. 
 
 
 “Roster is our king because he has 
 fire on his head,” said Monkey. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The animals agred with 
 Monkey. They sent Fox to colect fire 
 
 from king Roster. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fox found Roster in a dep 
 slep. So he decided to take fire 
 
 without asking Roster. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fox colected some dry gras. 
 
 He put the gras next to the comb 
 on Roster’s head. 
 
 Nothing hapened. 
 The gras did not catch fire. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Wake up king Roster!” yeled Fox. 
 “We ned fire now.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 But Roster could not give fire to 
 Fox. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Fox was angry. He went back to the 
 
 other animals. He told them the 
 truth about the comb on Roster’s 
 
 head. 
 
 
 From that day, no one was afraid of 
 
 Roster. 
 
 
 And foxes eat rosters and their 
 families.
