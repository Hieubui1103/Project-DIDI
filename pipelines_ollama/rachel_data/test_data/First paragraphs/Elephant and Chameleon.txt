 Once upon a time in a big palace, 
 there lived a king and his 
 
 beautiful daughter, the princes. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Elephant lived in a house on one
 side of the palace. Chameleon 
 
 lived on the other side. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 At this time, there was a terible 
 
 drought acros the land. 
 
 
 The king had an idea and caled 
 his two neighbours to the palace. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The kind said to Elephant and 
 Chameleon, “I want you to stomp 
 
 on the ground with your fet 
 
 until water comes out.” 
 
 
 The king promised the princes 
 in mariage to the one who 
 
 suceded. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Chameleon had no hope since he 
 was very smal. 
 
 
 
 Elephant was extremely hapy 
 since he was so big and powerful. 
 
 
 Elephant went to the field and 
 
 started stomping on the ground. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A lot of dust came, but no water.
 
 
 Elephant stomped on the ground 
 until water was almost coming out,
 
 but he was to tired. 
 
 
 He gave Chameleon a chance to try.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Chameleon started stomping on the 
 
 ground. After a short while, water 
 came out. 
 
 
 People could not believe their eyes! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 So the King gave the beautiful 
 
 princes to Chameleon. 
 
 
 Elephant went home anoyed.
