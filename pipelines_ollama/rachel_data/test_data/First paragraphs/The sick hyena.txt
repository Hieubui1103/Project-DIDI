 Once upon a time, a long time ago, 
 
 there was a time of great hunger. A 
 very smart hyena pretended he was 
 
 so sick he couldn’t even go out. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lots of animals went to visit him in 
 his home to comfort him. But none 
 
 of them ever came out! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One beautiful afternon, the rabit 
 arived. He thought he would like to 
 
 visit the hyena to. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 He almost went into the hyena’s 
 
 cave. But sudenly he stoped, and 
 saw there were only tracks of 
 
 animals going in, and none coming 
 out. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 So he stayed outside and shouted 
 
 into it, "How are you? Are you 
 healthy, my best friend? Are you 
 
 geting beter?" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The hyena answered, "Don’t wory, 
 my friend. Come in and give me 
 
 some lovely company!" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Oh, I'm not sure if I should come in. Realy, I don’t have time right
 now, and you have so many visitors . . .” 
 
 
 
 
 “No, no, rabit, everything is alright. There’s nobody in here. It's no
 
 god for me to stay here al sick and alone.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 "You are lying! I can se the 
 fotprints of animals that have gone 
 
 in but haven't come out . . . “ 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The hyena went quiet and the rabit 
 said, “God-bye, my friend, I think I 
 
 wil visit you another day.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 And the rabit ran far away from 
 that place!
