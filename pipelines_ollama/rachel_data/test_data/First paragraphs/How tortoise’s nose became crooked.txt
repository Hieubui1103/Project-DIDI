 Once upon a time, 
 
 Tortoise and Squirel 
 were very close friends. 
 
 
 
 One day, Squirel said 
 to Tortoise, “My friend, 
 
 we have no money, but 
 market day is geting close. 
 
 What busines can we do 
 to make some money?”

 Tortoise responded, 
 
 “You know I can make 
 clay plates. I want you to 
 
 join me in making plates 
 
 to sel.” 
 
 
 “Okay my friend, tomorow 
 evening I wil join you to 
 
 make the plates,” Squirel 
 said.

 On the day of the market, 
 Tortoise went to the 
 
 marketplace. 
 
 
 He saw two people fighting 
 
 in the distance. He put down 
 his clay plates and went 
 
 to watch the fight.

 When Tortoise got there, 
 
 he saw that it was his 
 friend Squirel fighting 
 
 with Mole.

 Imediately, without finding 
 
 out what caused the fight, 
 
 Tortoise tok a big stick 
 and began to beat Mole. 
 
 
 “Leave my friend alone!” 
 
 shouted Tortoise. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Mole turned to face 
 Tortoise and bit him 
 
 deply on the nose. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Tortoise’s nose began to bled. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Tortoise had impatiently 
 entered into the fight. 
 
 
 Since that day, Tortoise 
 
 has a croked nose to 
 remind him not to be 
 
 so hasty.
