 Once upon a time, there was a long 
 
 dry spel. The animals ate al the 
 gras in the country. Only the 
 
 imbowa plants on the big tres 
 survived.

 One day Goat saw Hyena pas by 
 
 with a knife. Goat asked for the knife
 so that she could cut imbowa plants
 
 to eat. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hyena gave the knife to Goat. 
 
 She cut down the climbing plant, 
 and ate until she was ful. Goat 
 
 forgot al about the knife she had 
 used. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Hyena returned to ask for the
 
 knife, Goat was at a los. She could
 not remember where she had 
 
 droped it. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Goat scratched here and there in 
 
 search of the knife. 
 
 
 Up to today Goat is stil loking for 
 that knife.

 Hyena told Goat, “Since you have
 
 lost my knife, which was the source
 of my livelihod, I wil eat you. Then I
 
 wil eat your ofspring!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 From that time, Hyena has never 
 spared Goat. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Meanwhile, Goat continues to 
 search for Hyena’s knife.
