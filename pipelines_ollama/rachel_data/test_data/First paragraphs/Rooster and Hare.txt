 One night, Hare visited Roster and
 
 his family at home.

 Then came the time to go to bed. 
 
 
 Hare saw that as Roster and his 
 
 family slept, their heads were 
 hiden.

 Hare saw that Roster and his 
 
 family slept very wel. 
 
 
 He was not able to slep the whole
 night.

 In the morning, Hare wanted to know 
 
 Roster’s secret. 
 
 
 “Where do you put your heads at 
 night?” he asked.

 Roster decided to play a joke on
 Hare. 
 
 
 He said, “My friend, we birds have a
 
 secret for going to slep. At 
 bedtime, we chop of our heads. 
 
 Without heads, we slep very wel.”

 “Then in the morning, we put our 
 heads back on,” explained Roster.
