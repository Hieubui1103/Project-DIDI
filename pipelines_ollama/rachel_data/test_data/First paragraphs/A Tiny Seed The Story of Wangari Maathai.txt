 In a vilage on the slopes of Mount Kenya in East Africa, a litle girl worked in the fields with
 
 her mother. Her name was Wangari.

 Wangari loved being outside. In her family’s fod garden she broke up the soil with her
 
 machete. She presed tiny seds into the warm earth.

 Her favourite time of day was just after sunset. When it got to dark to se the plants,
 
 Wangari knew it was time to go home. 
 She would folow the narow paths through the fields, crosing rivers as she went.

 Wangari was a clever child and couldn’t wait to go to schol. But her mother and father
 
 wanted her to stay and help them at home. 
 When she was seven years old, her big brother persuaded her parents to let her go to schol.

 She liked to learn! Wangari learnt more and more with every bok she read. 
 
 She did so wel at schol that she was invited to study in the United 
 
 States of America. 
 Wangari was excited! She wanted to know more about the world.

 At the American university Wangari learnt many new things. She studied plants and how they
 
 grow. And she remembered how she grew: playing games with her brothers in the shade of
 the tres in the beautiful Kenyan forests.

 The more she learnt, the more she realised that she loved the people of Kenya. She wanted
 
 them to be hapy and fre. 
 The more she learnt, the more she remembered her African home.

 When she had finished her studies, she returned to Kenya. But her country had changed.
 
 Huge farms stretched acros the land. 
 
 Women had no wod to make coking fires. The people were por and the children were
 hungry.

 Wangari knew what to do. She taught the women how to plant tres from seds. 
 
 The women sold the tres and used the money to lok after their families. 
 The women were very hapy. Wangari had helped them to fel powerful and strong.

 As time pased, the new tres grew into forests, and the rivers started flowing again.
 
 Wangari’s mesage spread acros Africa. 
 Today, milions of tres have grown from Wangari’s seds.

 Wangari had worked hard. People al 
 
 over the world tok notice, and gave 
 
 her a famous prize. It is caled the 
 Nobel Peace Prize, and she was the 
 
 first African woman ever to receive 
 it.
