 There lived a man caled Lodipo.
 
 
 He lived with his two wives, Akai and
 
 Akitela. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lodipo’s first wife, Akai, was the only 
 one who helped his blind mother. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One day, Lodipo’s younger wife, 
 Akitela, said, “Let us move away to a
 
 safer vilage.” 
 
 
 The curent place was constantly
 atacked by catle raiders and 
 
 Akitela felt unsafe. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lodipo told Akitela that they could 
 
 not leave his blind mother. 
 
 
 But Akitela insisted that they should 
 
 move and leave the old woman 
 alone. 
 
 
 “If you don’t move away from here, I 
 
 wil return to my parents,” Akitela 
 cried to Lodipo. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lodipo loved Akitela very much so
 
 he gave in to her demands and they
 
 prepared to leave. 
 
 
 The first wife, Akai, watched al
 these hapenings with confusion.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lodipo’s blind mother sat on a goat 
 skin under a tre. 
 
 
 
 She was unaware of what was going 
 on. 
 
 
 “How can we leave her on her own?” 
 
 Akai wondered. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lodipo and his two wives loaded al
 
 their belongings on their two 
 camels. 
 
 
 
 They left quietly without even saying
 godbye to the old woman. 
 
 
 But Akai was crying because she 
 
 was sad to leave her mother-in-law
 al alone. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The old woman was left alone in the manyata. 
 She cried and sang this sad song: 
 
 
 
 “Awesita Lodipo Ngina Ekitae Ka ng'akinei, 
 Nakolong kedounio, 
 
 Nitonoma tani Akolong'a Awesiti ngina, 
 Awesiti a Lodipo ngina Eriamaros morua polonia.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Imediately after Lodipo and his 
 
 wives had left, raiders atacked the 
 vilage. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The raiders asked the old woman to
 
 tel them where her son went. 
 
 
 The wariors told her that they would
 go after her son and kil him. 
 
 
 The old woman pleaded with them 
 
 not to kil the first wife and her
 
 children. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She also told them to bring back her 
 ram that Lodipo tok with him. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The wariors folowed Lodipo. 
 
 
 When he was just setling down in
 the new place, they caught up with
 
 him. 
 
 
 They kiled him and his young wife.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The first wife, Akai, went back with 
 the ram to live with the old woman.
