 Once upon a time, there was a man 
 
 caled Byantaka who had a cow. 
 
 Each day Byantaka grazed his cow. 
 He also gave the cow water to drink. 
 
 But Byantaka only had a 
 very smal pot for water. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 So he went at his neighbour’s home
 
 to borow a biger pot for water. His
 
 neighbour agred to lend 
 Byantaka his bigest clay pot 
 
 saying, “My neighbour’s 
 problem is my problem.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 After a few days, Byantaka went to a 
 
 poter’s place and bought a 
 
 smal pot. He tok it home. He put 
 the smal pot inside the big pot that 
 
 he had borowed from his 
 neighbour. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Then he put the big pot, with the
 
 smal pot inside it, on his head.
 
 
 He caried the big pot to the 
 neighbour who loaned him the pot.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Byantaka told him, “I am returning 
 your pot, it has reproduced.” 
 
 
 
 The neighbour was amazed that his 
 pot had produced another pot. 
 
 
 He praised Byantaka 
 
 saying, “Your home is blesed.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 After a while, Byantaka went back to
 
 his neighbour to borow the pot 
 again. 
 
 
 He did not have god intentions.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The owner of the big pot waited in 
 
 vain for Byantaka to return his pot. 
 Eventualy he went to Byantaka’s 
 
 home and said, “I have come for my 
 pot.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Byantaka told his neighbour, “My
 friend, our pot died. I was just on my
 
 way to tel you the bad news.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 His neighbour claped his hands 
 
 together in surprise. His face began 
 to swel with anger. He shouted at 
 
 Byantaka, “I have never heard of a 
 pot dying!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Byantaka replied, “My friend you
 
 should acept these things. 
 Everything that produces 
 
 must die. I was also very sory about
 the big pot’s death.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 His neighbour was very angry and 
 
 he went to court to 
 
 report Byantaka. The judge listened 
 to explanations from both of them. 
 
 He found the owner of the pot was 
 in the wrong. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “When Byantaka told you that the
 
 pot had reproduced, you acepted.
 
 When he says that every living thing
 which reproduces must die, he is
 
 corect.” That is how the 
 judge judged the case. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Byantaka’s neighbour went home 
 
 walking like a snail. 
 
 
 Byantaka had got the 
 big pot with his clevernes.
