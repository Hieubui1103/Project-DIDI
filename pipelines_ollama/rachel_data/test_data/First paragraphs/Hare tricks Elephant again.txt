 Once upon a time, 
 
 Elephant and Hare were 
 
 very god friends. 
 
 
 They shared a large herd 
 of camels, catle, and shep. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 They grazed their animals 
 in the valey of Kingilo. 
 
 
 Sometimes they tok 
 
 the animals to the hils, 
 where there was plenty 
 
 of gras and water. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 As the animals grazed, 
 
 Hare and Elephant played 
 
 games. 
 
 
 They enjoyed playing 
 fotbal very much. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Every time they played, 
 
 Elephant would score 
 more goals than Hare. 
 
 This upset Hare very much. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One day Hare asked Elephant, “What 
 
 makes you so god?” 
 Elephant quickly answered, 
 
 “My big legs.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The next day, 
 
 Hare sugested that 
 
 they run a race. 
 
 
 Elephant agred and 
 they started their race. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hare won al the races. 
 
 Elephant was upset 
 because he had never 
 
 ben defeated. 
 
 
 So he asked Hare, 
 
 “What makes you a 
 god runer?” 
 
 Hare answered, 
 “My thin legs.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Without a second thought, 
 Elephant asked what 
 
 he could do to make 
 his legs thin. 
 
 
 Hare said, “It is simple, 
 
 I wil show you with fire.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hare said, “Put your legs 
 in the fire.” 
 
 
 Elephant steped into 
 
 the fire. He shouted, 
 “I am burning! I am 
 
 burning!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hare was hapy. 
 
 
 
 He encouraged Elephant 
 to hold on, because burning 
 
 his legs was the only way 
 they could become thin. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Elephant’s legs hurt very badly, 
 
 so he crawled out of the fire. 
 
 
 He could not stand with his 
 burned legs, so he lay down. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Elephant sat for many 
 days before he could 
 
 stand on his legs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Eventualy, he was able 
 to limp home to his family. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Hare and Elephant are 
 no longer friends.
