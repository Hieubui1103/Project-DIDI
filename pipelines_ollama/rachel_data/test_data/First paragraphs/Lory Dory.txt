 One night Grandpa was tucking me
 in. His hands were soft and his hair
 
 was thin. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “I’m going to tel you a special 
 story, about a girl named Lory Dory.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You couldn’t se Lory Dory at 
 al because she was born invisible.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 You’d only se Lory when rain hit her 
 head, 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 or when she was curled under 
 blankets in bed. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lory was left out of al the kids’ 
 games. They teased her and they 
 
 caled her names. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Lok, it’s Lory. The Imaginary 
 Friend! She’s not like us, she’s just
 
 pretend!” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One day at schol, a boy wanted to 
 know: “How do you lok? I only se 
 
 you in snow.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 8  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Can you paint yourself?” Lory knew that she could. 
 
 But not in the same way the boy thought she would. 
 
 
 9  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lory painted her body with al that she loved from the world al around and the sky up above.
 
 
 
 10  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She painted herself every day with
 such pride, to bring out the person
 
 who she was inside. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “I know I’m invisible and hard to 
 se. So I painted these pictures to 
 
 show the real me.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 12  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 “Are you making this up, Gramps? Is
 
 this story true?” 
 
 
 “Lory is real – real as me, real as
 you.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 13  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 When Grandpa had left me, I can’t 
 quite be sure, but I think I saw Lory 
 
 just outside my dor.
