 Once upon a time there was a 
 husband and wife with children. 
 
 
 The mother prepared fod for 
 
 the family each day. She would bring
 the meal to the table for 
 
 them to eat.

 The father would divide the meat. 
 
 He would say to the eldest child, 
 “I am old enough for meat. Here is 
 
 yours. Wait until you are older.”

 Then he would say to the next 
 
 child, “I am old enough for 
 meat. Here is yours. Wait until 
 
 you are older.” 
 
 
 It went like this for al the 
 children. The youngest child 
 
 got the tiniest piece of meat.

 The father kept the big pieces 
 
 of meat for himself and his wife. 
 
 
 The children were quiet and 
 ate their fod.

 Years pased and the children 
 grew up. The parents grew old. 
 
 They became helples. 
 
 
 The children tok turns 
 preparing fod for their old 
 
 mother and father.

 One day at meal time, the 
 
 eldest child served the meat as 
 usual. But this time she gave 
 
 only a tiny piece to her father 
 and a tiny piece to her mother. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 She said to her parents, “You 
 
 ate yours, now it is our time. 
 
 We are old enough.” 
 
 
 She served most of the meat 
 to her brothers and sisters.

 The father remembered what 
 
 he did while his children were young. 
 
 
 Mother and father agred that 
 
 it was not the right thing to do. 
 They asked for forgivenes.
