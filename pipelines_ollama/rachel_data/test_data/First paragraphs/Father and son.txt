 Edawaliwo omusaja nga ye 
 Nsangabisibe. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 There was a man caled Enzo. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 1  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Omusaja ono yalina mutabani nga 
 ye Muduawulira. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 This man had a son. 
 
 The son's name was Paul. 
 
 
 
 
 
 2  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Lumu tata yagamba mutabaniwe 
 nti jangu tutambuleko. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 One day the man said to his son,
 
 “Let’s go for a walk.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 3  
 
 
 
 
 
 Bwe bali batambula, nebasanga 
 
 omugugu omusibe obulungi enyo. 
 Omugugu nga gusanyusa okulaba. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On the way, they saw a very nice 
 
 suitcase. It was packed ful. 
 
 
 
 
 
 4  
 
 
 
 
 Tata nakwatibwa amadu 
 
 nagamba Muduawuliranti, 
 “Situla omugugu ogwetike 
 
 tugutwale eka.” 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The man got very excited. 
 He said to his son, 
 
 “Pick it up and we wil take 
 it home.” 
 
 
 
 
 5  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Omwana nasitula omugugu 
 neyetika. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The son did what the father told him 
 
 to do. Paul put the suitcase on his 
 
 head and caried it. 
 
 
 
 
 6  
 
 
 
 
 
 Batambulako katono, omusota 
 
 neguva mumugugu negumugwa 
 kubigere! 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 On the way home, a snake slithered
 out of the suitcase. 
 
 
 It landed on Paul's fet! 
 
 
 
 
 7  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Tata ne mutabaniwe batya nyo 
 era nebasula omugugu nebaduka. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Father and son were both very 
 
 scared. Paul droped the suitcase. 
 
 They ran away very fast!
